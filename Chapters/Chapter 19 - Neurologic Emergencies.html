          The nervous system is divided into two parts. The
          <strong>central nervous system (CNS)</strong> and the
          <strong>peripheral nervous system (PNS)</strong>

          The brain is divded into three parts: the brainstem, cerebellum, and
          cerebrum. The brainstem controls breathing, blood pressure,
          swallowing, and pupil constriction. The cerebellum controls muscle and
          body coordination, it coordinates voluntary movement of muscles.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cerebrum is subdivided into two parts, the left and right
          hemispheres. Each hemisphere controls the opposite side of the body.
          However the cerebrum activity is distributed from front to back. The
          front controls emotion and thought, middle controls touch and
          movement, and the back processed sight.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are twelve cranial nerve that run from the brain to the various
          parts of the head, ones that go to the rest of the body join in the
          spinal cord and exit through the <b>foramen magnum</b>.

    <h2>Neurons and Impulse Transmission</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The neuron is a fundamental element of the nervous system. Neurons are
      comprosied of three parts: cell body, axon, and dendrites. The
      <strong>axon</strong> is a projection from the cell body that extends
      toward another cell carrying signal away from the neruon. The axon could
      be wrapped in a sheat of <strong>myelin</strong>, this insulating
      substance that allows the cell to transmit a signal efficiently and
      consistently. Myelin also increases the speed of conduction.
    </p>
    <h3>Synapses</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Synapses</strong> are the junctions where neurons interact. It is
      important to remember nerve cells do not actually have direct contact, but
      there is actually a slight gap. This gap allows for fine control. The
      communication occurs through chemical release called neurotransmitters
      from the first cell.
    </p>
    <h3>Neurotransmitters</h3>
    <p>
      Some examples of neurotransmitters are dopamine, acetylcholine,
      epinephrine and serotonin. These chemicals allow the electrical signal to
      be conducted from one nerve cell to the next.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nerve cells have to respond or not, there is not such thing as a neuron
      firing weakly.

    <h2>Stroke</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Stroke otherwise known as a
      <strong>(cerebrovascular accident (CVA)</strong> is when there is an
      interruption of blood flow to the brain, this usually results in loss of
      function in the affected part of the brain. Due to the lack of blood flow
      to parts of the brain the cells will begin to die. These dead cells are
      called <strong>infarcted cells</strong>. After a cell dies there is little
      to do, however cell death can take several hours and can be prvented if
      care is rendered allowing for blood flow to be restored. If blood is
      obstructed but not fully blocked then this will allow cells to receieve
      the blood flow they need to survive, these cells are called ischemic
      cells. In these cases the cells receieve the blood flow they need to stay
      alive but not they will still be unable to function properly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Interruption of blood flow can be caused by a few things, such as a
      <strong>thrombus</strong> which is a clot that has developed. A
      <strong>arterial rupture</strong>, or a
      <strong>cerebral embolism</strong>.
    </p>
    <p class="h h-red">
      Keep in mind that a thrombus is a clot that develops locally while a
      embolism is a clot that formed somewhere else and traveled to the
      location.
    </p>
    <p>There are two types of strokes, hemorrhagic and ischemic.</p>
    <div class="columns">
      <div class="flex-50">
        <h3>Ischemic Stroke</h3>
        <p>
          This type of stroke occurs when a blood vessel is blocked. Eventually
          if blood flow is not restored these cells will die.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another disorder than can cause a obstruction is
          <strong>atherosclerosis</strong>. This disease causes a buildup of
          calcium and cholestrol inside the walls of the blood vessels. Overtime
          the plaque that is formed can cause a complete obstruction
        </p>
        <p>
          When cells start to become ischemic they will switch to anaerobic
          metabolism. This type of metabolism is not made for long periods of
          time as it creates less amount of energy and it produces an acidic
          by-product.
        </p>
        <p>
          One problem that can occur is if there is a partial obstruction in a
          carotid artery then there is a risk of smaller pieces of the clot
          breaking off and being carried deep into the brain.
        </p>
        <h3>Hemorrahic Stroke</h3>
        <p>
          This type of stroke occurs when there is bleeding within the brain.
          This can be caused by a blood vessel rupturing and the blood forming a
          clot. Hemorrahgic strokes can vary widely as it depends on where the
          bleeding is located inside the brain and the sze of the rupture.
        </p>
        <p>
          As bleeding continues
          <strong>intracranial pressure (ICP)</strong> will begin to increase
          causes brain tissue to become compressed. Compression of the brain
          tissue causes oxygenated blood to be unable to reach those parts of
          the brain.
        </p>
        <p>
          One reason for hemorrhagic strokes are aneurysms. Aneurysms can occur
          for some of the following reasons:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A small tear or defect occurs within the wall of an artery</li>
          <li>Blood penetrates between the layers of the artery</li>
          <li>
            Pressure builds up, and the initial small tear increases in size
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When this occurs the wall of the artery is weakened causing it to be
          unable to withstand the pressure of blood flowing. As blood flows
          through the artery this weakened section will begin to bulge, this
          causes it to leak or fail catastrophically.
        </p>
        <p>
          When an aneurysm ruptures and causes bleeding in the area between the
          covering of the brain this is called a subarachnoid hemorrhage. As
          bleeding continues and ICP increases the brain can be compressed and
          forced out through the foramen magnum, this process is called
          <strong>herniation</strong>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="flex-50">
        <img src="./images/chapter 19/clot.png" />
        <img src="./images/chapter 19/embolus.png" />
      </div>
    </div>
    <h3>Intracranial Pressure</h3>
    <p>
      There are three substances within the skull that exert pressure, the
      brain, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid. It is imporant for this balance to
      be maintained as it allows the brain to fit snugly within the skull. If
      this wasn't the case there would be void areas within the skull, this
      would allow the brain to move around and potentially slam into the skull.
    </p>
    <p>
      As ICP increases the amount of blood avaliable to the brain decreases.This
      pressure is known as <strong>cerebral perfusion pressue (CPP)</strong>.
    </p>
    <img src="./images/chapter 19/ICP.png" />
    <p>
      Multiple problems can arrise from increase ICP, one being the brain
      becoming ischemic due to lack of a blood supply or herniation.
    </p>
    <h3>Transient Ischemic Attack</h3>
    <p>
      In some patients the bodies normal processes will be able to destory a
      clot that is causing an obstruction. When this happens blood flow is
      restored to the brain and patients symptoms will resolve. If their
      symptoms resolve within 24 hours then these cases are known as
      <strong>transient ischemic attack (TIA)</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The postivie part of TIAs is they leave no lasting damage or symptoms.
      However TIAs can be good warning signs fo a serious vascular condition.
      Approximately 1/3 of patients who experience a TIA will have an stroke in
      the future.

        <p>
          The dura is a leathery covering over the brain next to the skull. A
          fracture can cause bleeding from an artery on top of the dura which
          results in pressure on the brain. This type of pressure usually occurs
          rapidly. On the other hand If the fracture causes bleeding below the
          dura it is usually from veins, these symptmos occur more slowly

    <h4>Tonic-Clonic Seizures</h4>
    <strong>Tonic-clonic seizures (formerly grand mal seizures)</strong> usually
    follow a pattern, although not every patient will experience every step. The
    steps are as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong
          >Aura is the sensation the patient experiences before a seizure
          occurs. Some examples of aura are:</strong
        >
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>Muscle twitching</li>
        <li>Odd taste</li>
        <li>Seeing lights</li>
        <li>Hearing high-pitched noise</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Loss of consciousness</li>
      <li>Tonic phase (body-wide rigidity)</li>
      <li>Hypertonic phase (arched back and rigidity)</li>
      <li>Clonic phase are rhythmic contractions of major muscle groups</li>
      <li>
        Postseizure is when the major muscle relax, nystagmus (rhythmic eye
        movement) can still occur
      </li>
      <li>
        Postictal phase is the reset period of the brain, during this time
        patient will slowly return to preseizure
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      During tonic-clonic seizures the patients respirations can become erratic,
      loud, and patient may become apneic. These periods of apnea should be
      short and last no longer than 30 seconds.
    </p>
    <h4>Pseudoseizures</h4>
    <p>
      The main difference between tonic-clonic and pseudoseizures is that
      psuedoseizures are psychiatric in orgin. An imporant thing to remember is
      the patient is not intentionally causing this behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pseudoseizures are usually triggered from an emotional event, stress,
      lights, or pain.

          These types of seizures present with little or no movement. Typically
          children will present with these types of seizures. They will usually
          stop moving, speaking, or freeze with a toy in their hand.

        <h4>Partial Seizures</h4>
        <p>
          These types of seizures can be classified as
          <strong>simple partial</strong> or <strong>complex partial</strong>.
          These types of seizures involve a portion of the brain. These can be
          localized to just one spot or move in a wakelike manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Simple partial seizures</strong> involve one part of the body,
          this can be from movement or altered sensations. This movement can
          either stay in one part of the body or spread in a wave-like movement.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Complex partial seizures</strong> involve subtle changes in
          the LOC. Patients may become confused or less alert, experience
          hallucinations or be unable to speak.
        </p>

    <h3>Status Epilepticus</h3>
    <p>
      This seizure lasts longer for more than 4 or 5 minutes, these seizures
      also can occur consecutively without return of consciousness. This time
      frame does vary and is best to check your local protocol.
    </p>
    <h3>Common Causes of Seizures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Abscess</li>
      <li>Alcohol</li>
      <li>Birth anomaly</li>
      <li>Brain infections (meningitis, encephalitis)</li>
      <li>Brain trauma</li>
      <li>Diabetes mellitus</li>
      <li>Fever (rapid rate of rise)</li>
      <li>Hypertension during pregnancy (eclampsia)</li>
      <li>Idiopathic (no known cause)</li>
      <li>Inappropriate medication dosage</li>
      <li>Organic brain syndromes</li>
      <li>Recreational drug use</li>
      <li>Stroke or TIA</li>
      <li>Systemic infection</li>
      <li>Tumor</li>
      <li>Uremia (kidney failure)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Some seizures can be caused by high fevers, this is called a
      <strong>febrile seizure</strong>. You can use a mnemonic known as
      <b>FACTS</b> to help obtain pertinent history
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Focus (Generalized or focal?)</li>
      <li>Activity (Type of movements?)</li>
      <li>Color or Cocaine (Cyanosis? Indications of cocaine use?)</li>
      <li>Time (How long did the seizure last?)</li>
      <li>
        Secondary information (Medciations? Events leading up to the seizures?
        Incontinence? Tongue biting?)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The Postictal State</h3>
    <p>
      After a seizure has occured the patient's muscles relax, become flacid or
      floppy, and breathing becomes laborered. The increased respiratory rate
      helps to compensate for the buildup of acids. After the pH in the body has
      balanced the breathing will return to normal.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some cases there can be
      <strong>hemiparesis (weakness on side of the body)</strong>. The postictal
      state causes the patient to be lethargic and confused, this can cause
      issues as the patient may become combative.
    </p>
    <h2>Altered Mental Status</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      This is the most common type of neurologic emergency. Altered mental
      status means the patient is not thinking clearly or incapable of being
      aroused. Causes for this can vary such as: hypoglycemia, hypoxemia,
      intoxication, drug overdose, unrecognized head injury, brain infection,
      body temperature abnormalities, brain tumors, and overdoses.
    </p>
    <h3>Hypoglycemia</h3>
    <p>
      Since glucose is needed for the brain to function patients with
      hypoglycemia have the possibility to present with stroke like symptoms.
      The difference is that a patient having a stroke will attempt to
      communicate normally where a patient with hypoglycemia almost always has
      an altered mental status.
    </p>
    <h2>Syncope</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <strong>Syncope (fainting)</strong> is a sudden and temporary loss of
      consciousness. This medical condition affects 1% to 3% of all emergency
      department visits. When someone has a syncopal episode it is important to
      determine what caused this episode to happen, some reasons are: cardiac
      dysrhythmia, myocardial infarction, dehydration, hypoglycemia, and a
      vasovagal episode.
    </p>
    <h3>Headache</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Tension headaches, migraines, and sinus headaches are the most common
      types of headaches and are condiered non-life threatening.
    </p>
    <p>
      A migrain is a complex condition that is caused by minor instability
      within certain clusters of neurons and also changes in blood vessel size
      at the base of the brain. Patients may experience an aura, and unilateral,
      focused pain that spreads over time. Patients will describe the pain as
      throbbing, pounding, or pulsating. Migraines can last over several days.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two other type of headaches, cluter headaches and sinus
      headaches. Cluster headaches last for 30 to 45 minutes, and may occur
      multiple times a day. Sinus headaches however are caused by inflammation
      or infection within the sinus cavities of the fact. This pain is located
      in the superior portions of the face and increases with bending the head
      forward.

    <h2>Hypoglycemia</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      There are two medications that can be used to treat hypoglycemia, these
      are dextrose and glucagon. If patient is
      <span class="h h-red">hypotensive administer 20mL/kg</span> of normal
      fluid. Be careful when administering a fluid bolus as giving patients
      excess fluid in hemorrhagic strokes can increase ICP.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is recommended to adminster 12.5g of dextrose if there is no blood
      glucose analysis monitor avaliable. When adminstering dextrose it is
      preferrable to obtain an 18 gauge IV as D<sub>50</sub> is very viscous.
      <span class="h h-red"
        >MAKE SURE IV IS PATENT BEFORE ADMINSTERING DEXTROSE</span
      >, if D<sub>50</sub> makes it into the interstitial space it can cause
      severe damage to muscles, nerves, and skin. The usualy dosage of D<sub
        >50</sub
      >
      is 25g or one full syringe. The onset is 30 seconds to 2 minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are unable to obtain vascular access administer 0.5 to 1mg of
      glucagon intramuscularly. LOC and blood glucose analysis should increase
      within 20 minutes. Glucagon can be repeated up to a maximum of three
      doses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another option to help raise blood glucose is oral glucose. These usually
      come in 25g (one tube). However this option is only viable if the patient
      is able to maintain their own airway. Some alternatives are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cake icing</li>
      <li>Plain chocolate bar</li>
      <li>Orange juice with suagr added</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      There is currently no way to lower blood sugar in the prehospital setting.
    </p>
    <h2>Stroke/TIA, Syncope, and Headache</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Perform supportive care. Maintain an SPO2 above 94%, support airway and breathing.</p>
