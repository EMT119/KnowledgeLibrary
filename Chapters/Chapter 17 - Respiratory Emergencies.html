    <h1 class="bg-dark-red">Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Dyspnea</strong> or difficulty breathing is something you will
      encounter quite often. Causes for this can be caused by many different
      conditions such as the common cold, asthma, heart failure, and pulmonary
      embolism. Some of these problems will be life-threatening.

    <p>
      Gas exchange is the process of which deoxygenated blood from pulmonary
      circulation releases carbon dioxide and is resupplied with oxygen before
      it enteres the cardiac circulation. Alveoli (tiny air sacs clustered
      around the terminal bronchioles in the lungs) are what causes the exchange
      to happen. These structures are very thin and lack structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pulmonary circulation begins at the right ventricle, where the
      pulmonary artery (the only artery that primarily carries deoxygenated
      blood) branches into increasingly smaller vessels until the pulmonary
      capillary bed surrounds the alveoli and terminal bronchioles. There is
      substantially more circulation to the lung bases than there is to the lung
      apices. Because humans are upright, gravity-dependent creatures, most
      infections and pathologic conditions occur at the base of the lung.

    <h2>Physiology Review</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Respiration</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The principal function of the lungs is <strong>respiration</strong>, which
      is the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. The two processes that occur
      during respiration are inspiration (inhaling) and expiration (exhaling).
      <strong>Ventilation</strong> is the mechanical process of moving air into
      and out of the lungs for gas exchange. During pulmonary respiration,
      oxygen is provided to the blood, and carbon dioxide is removed from it.
      Oxygen entering the alveoli from inhalation passes through tiny passages
      in the alveolar wall into the capillaries, which carry the oxygen to the
      heart. The heart, in turn, pumps oxygenated blood throughout the body.
      Carbon dioxide produced by the body's cells returns to the lungs in the
      blood that circulates through and around the alveolar air spaces. The
      carbon dioxide diffuses back into the alveoli and travels back up the
      bronchial tree and out the upper airways during exhalation. Again, carbon
      dioxide is “exchanged” for oxygen, which travels in exactly the opposite
      direction (during inhalation).
    </p>
    <h3>Inspiration</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The stimulus to breathe comes from the respiratory center located in the
      medulla. The involuntary control of breathing originates in the brainstem,
      specifically in the pons and medulla. The impulses for automatic breathing
      descend through the spinal cord and can be overridden (to a point) by
      voluntary control. The motor nerves of respiration are the phrenic nerves,
      which innervate the diaphragm, and the intercostal nerves, which innervate
      the external intercostal muscles (muscles between the ribs).
    </p>
    <p>
      During inspiration, the diaphragm and intercostal muscles contract,
      causing the diaphragm to flatten and the ribs to move up and out. The
      combined actions of these structures enlarge the thorax in all directions,
      causing intrapulmonary pressure to fall slightly below atmospheric
      pressure (the air pressure outside the body). As the diaphragm and
      intercostal muscles contract and the thoracic cage expands, air pressure
      within the thorax decreases, creating a slight vacuum. This pulls air in
      through the trachea and fills the lungs, inflating the alveoli. When the
      air pressure outside the thorax equals the air pressure inside the thorax,
      air stops moving, and a person stops inhaling. Oxygen and carbon dioxide
      are then able to diffuse across the alveolar membrane from an area of
      higher pressure to an area of lower pressure until the pressures are
      equal. Normal inspiratory reserve volume, the amount of air that can be
      inhaled in addition to normal tidal volume (about 500 mL), is about 3,000
      mL in a typical adult male and 2,300 mL in a typical adult female.
    </p>
    <h3>Expiration</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
      As the chest expands, mechanical receptors, known as stretch receptors, in
      the chest wall and bronchioles send a signal to the apneustic center via
      the vagus nerve to inhibit the inspiratory center, and expiration occurs.
      This feedback loop, a combination of mechanical and neural control, is
      known as the
      <strong>Hering-Breuer reflex</strong> and terminates inhalation to prevent
      overexpansion of the lungs. The diaphragm and intercostal muscles relax,
      moving the ribs down and in and the diaphragm back into its dome shape,
      which increases intrapulmonary pressure. The natural elasticity, or
      recoil, of the lungs passively removes the air. Normal expiratory reserve
      volume, the amount of air that can be exhaled following normal exhalation,
      is about 1,200 mL.
    </p>
    <p>
      Normally, expiration lasts twice as long as inspiration. This relationship
      is expressed by the inspiratory/expiratory (I/E) ratio; a normal I/E ratio
      is 1:2. When a patient's lower airway is obstructed and he or she has
      difficulty getting air out (such as in asthma), the expiratory phase is
      prolonged and may be four to five times as long as inspiration. In the
      case of a patient with asthma, the I/E ratio would be 1:4 or 1:5. In a
      patient with tachypnea (rapid respiratory rate), the expiratory phase is
      short and approaches that of inspiration; the I/E ratio may be 1:1.

    <h1 class="bg-dark-red">Pathophysiology</h1>
    <p>
      For the body to receive the required nutrients and oxygen and to dispose
      of waste products, adequate ventilation, diffusion, and perfusion must
      occur. There are multiple complications that interfere with an ample
      intake of oxygen. These can be separated into four areas:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Upper airway obstruction may be from a foreign body obstruction, trauma,
        or an inflammation such as tonsillitis or epiglottitis.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lower airway obstruction may be caused by trauma. Obstructive lung
        disease and other complications, such as mucus accumulation,
        smooth-muscle spasm, and airway edema, can also create narrowing and
        blockage of the lower airways.
      </li>
      <li>
        Chest wall impairment is another cause of impaired ventilation. Trauma,
        hemothorax, pneumothorax, empyema (pleural effusion), pleural
        inflammation, and neuromuscular diseases such as multiple sclerosis or
        muscular dystrophy prevent adequate chest wall excursion.
      </li>
      <li>
        Problems in neurologic control can impair ventilation. These include
        brainstem malfunction from central nervous system depressant drugs,
        stroke or other medical neurologic condition, or trauma. Trauma and
        neuromuscular diseases can also cause phrenic or spinal nerve
        dysfunction, preventing normal neurologic control. By rapidly assessing
        the patient and providing the necessary interventions, problems
        associated with oxygenation and ventilation can be minimized or avoided
        altogether.

    <h2>Gas Exchange Interface</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>Alveoli are made up of two types of cells:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Type I alveolar cells (pneumocytes) are almost empty, allowing for
        better gas exchange. They lack cellular components that would permit
        them to reproduce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Each alveolus has several type II pneumocytes, which can make new type I
        cells and produce a substance known as surfactant, which reduces surface
        tension and helps keep the alveoli expanded. When alveoli are damaged by
        infection, cigarette smoking, or other trauma, their ability to repair
        themselves correlates directly to the number of type II cells that
        remain. After all type II cells in an alveolus have been destroyed, the
        alveolus cannot make new cells or surfactant and is essentially dead.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Alveoli are best kep partially inflated. Surfactant reduces the surface
      tension of the alveoli making it easier for them to expand. Whenever the
      surfactant is wash out they are more likely to collapse.
    </p>
    <p>
      If foreign material gets into the bronchioles and alveoli it typically
      never comes out. Some things can result from this such as emphysema
      causing damage or destroying the structural components that are present.
      This causes the tracheobronchial tree to become weak that it collapses,
      this traps air in the alveoli.
    </p>
    <p>
      If an alveoli is filled with fluid or collapsed it does not perform gas
      exchange. This allows unoxygenated blood to return to the left side of the
      heart resulting in hypoexmia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pulmonary capillaries are narrow and allow red blood cells to pass through
      in a single file line. However people with chronic lung disease or chronic
      hypoxia generate a surplus of red blood cells. This makes their blood
      thick <strong>polycythemia</strong>. This viscous blood is pushed through
      the pulmonary capillaries and places a strain on the right side of the
      heart. Whenever someone develops right sided heart failure from a chronic
      lung disease this is known as <strong>cor pulmonale</strong>
    </p>
    <h2>Carbon Dioxide Retention and Hypoxic Drive</h2>
    <p>
      Patients with elevated levels of carbon dioxide can be caused from
      numerous reasons. Some of the causes could be lung disease, the body
      producing an abnormally high amount of carbon dioxide (either temporarily
      or chronically). If these levels rise slowly to an abnormally high level
      the respiratory center in the brain will work less efficiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Failure of the respiratory centers to respond is a result of chronic
      <strong>carbon dioxide retention</strong>. Normally, chemoreceptors sense
      the levels of carbon dioxide in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid.
      Normally the respiratory centers would respond by increaseing the rate and
      depth of respirations to correct the rising levels of carbon dioxide,
      however over time the brain begins to accomodate the higher levels of
      carbon dioxide. The brain will being to use a "backup system" to control
      breathing based on low levels of oxygen. This is called
      <strong>hypoxic drive</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The complication that can arise when treating these patients is that their
      stimuls to breathe is from the low oxygen levels. By administering oxygen
      and raising the arterial oxygen level you can decrease their oxygen drive
      causing their respirations to decrease or stop. However it is important to
      note to never withold oxygen from a patient who needs it.
    </p>
    <h2>Hypoventilation</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Whenever the lungs fail to work properly they cannot dispose of carbon
      dioxide correctly and it will begin to accumulate in the blood. This
      excess causes a chemical to form called carbonic acid which is the
      combination of carbon dioxide and water. This results in
      <strong>respiratory acidosis</strong>

      pH is the inverse expression of the amount of free hydrogen ions in a
      solution. This means that carbon dioxide is direcly releated to the pH in
      the blood. Hyperventilation causes respiratory alkalosis with a high pH
      due to carbon dioxide levels decreasing. Hypoventilation causes
      respiratory acidosis which decreases pH levels due to carbon dioxide
      levels increasing.

          posioning or giving infants raw honey. This disease can cause muscle
          paralysis and is usually fatal when it reaches the respiratory
          muscles.

        <b>Conditions that reduc respiratory drive</b>. The most common cause is
        opioid narcotic overdose. Alcohol intoxication. Head injury, hypoxic
        drive, and asphyxia are associated with grossly low respirate rate and
        volume. This is usually follow by respiratory arrest and then cardiac
        arrest.

    <h2>Hyperventilation</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <strong>Hyperventilation</strong> is defined as overbreathing to the point
      that the level of arterial carbon dioxide falls below normal. This can be
      an indicator of a life-threatening illness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alkalosis can be symptoms associated with
      <strong>hyperventilation syndrome (panic attack)</strong>, some symptoms
      include anxiety, dizziness, numbness, tingling of the heads and feets
      known as <strong>carpopedal spasm</strong> in which the hands and feet
      become clenched in a clawlike position. This form of hyperventilation is
      usually not associated with any other illness but instead caused by
      psychological stress.

    <h2>Acute Pulmonary Edema</h2>
    <hr />
    <div class="columns">
      <div class="flex-50">
        <p>
          <strong>Pulmonary edema</strong> is an accumulation of fluid in the
          lungs, this is caused by various reasons. Fluid accumulation will
          cause a decrease in gas exchange resulting in dyspnea. Myocardial
          damage is the main cause of this, it is a reduced contractile force of
          the myocardium. This means blood cannot be ejected from the left
          ventricle faster than it is being delivered by the left atrium. Once
          this fluid begins to back up into the alveoli and lung tissue there
          will be no room for gas exchange.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pulmonary edema can develop rapidly following a major cardiovascular
          insult. Patients will usually present with dyspnea with rapid, shallow
          respirations. In some cases you will note frothy pink sputum coming
          from the nose and mouth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pulmonary edema is not always associated with heart disease. Inhaling
          smoke or toxic chemical fumes can produce pulmonary eedema, some other
          reasons is traumaic injuries to the chest and exposure to high
          altitudes.
        </p>
        <p>
          In some cases patients may present with drypnea,

    <h2>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</h2>
    <hr />
    <div class="columns">
      <div class="flex-50">
        <p>
          <strong>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)</strong> is
          common lung condition that is a slow process of dilation adn
          disruption of the airways and alveoli caused by chronic bronchial
          obstruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          COPD can be a result of repeated infections or inhalation of toxic
          gases and particles, however it most commonly related to ciragrette
          smoking. Obstruction occurs in the bronchioles. This happens when the
          cilia are unable to remove excess mucus. Whenever this happens air
          becomes trapped distally to the obstruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tobacco smoke is a bronchial irritant and can create chronic
          bronchitis, an ongoing irritation of the trachea and bronchi. Chronic
          bronchitis results from overgrowth of the airway mucous glands and
          excess secretion of mucus, which blocks the airway. Patients have a
          chronic productive cough. The clinical definition of chronic
          bronchitis is a productive cough for at least 3 months per year for 2
          or more consecutive years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pneumonia can easily develop whenever passages are persistently
          obstructed. Repeated episodrs of irritation and pneumonia cause
          scarring in the lung causing dilation of the obstructed alveoli.
        </p>
        <p>
          Emphysema is an irreversible condition; however, with proper
          treatment, its progression can be slowed. Emphysema also makes the
          alveoli susceptible to collapse (atelectasis). Chronically low oxygen
          levels associated with emphysema stimulate the production of red blood
          cells, sometimes in excessive quantity (polycythemia). As a result,
          the patient’s skin tends to remain pink.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="flex-50">
        <img src="./images/chapter 17/chapter17 - COPD.png" />
        <p>
          The most common form of COPD is emphysema. Emphysema is a degenerative
          condition characterized by destruction of the alveolar walls related
          to the destruction of pulmonary surfactant. Surfactant is a substance
          that lines and lubricates the alveolar walls, allowing them to easily
          expand and recoil. After the amount of surfactant is reduced,
          elasticity is diminished. With emphysema, elastic material in the
          lungs is lost when the alveolar air spaces are chronically stretched
          as a result of inflamed airways and obstruction of airflow out of the
          lungs. Normally, the lungs act like spongy balloons that are inflated;
          after they are inflated, they will naturally recoil because of their
          elastic nature, expelling gas rapidly. However, when they are
          constantly obstructed or when the elasticity is diminished, air is no
          longer expelled rapidly, and the walls of the alveoli eventually fall
          apart, leaving large “holes” in the lung that resemble large air
          pockets or cavities.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Most patients with COPD have elements of both chronic bronchitis and
      emphysema. They have a history of recurring lung problems and are almost
      always long-term cigarette smokers. Some patients will have more elements
      of one condition than the other; few patients will have only emphysema or
      bronchitis. Therefore, most patients with COPD will produce sputum, have a
      chronic cough, and have difficulty expelling air from their lungs, with
      long expiration phases and wheezing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The patient in an acute COPD episode will complain of shortness of breath
      with gradually increasing symptoms over a period of days and often exhales
      through pursed lips. Patients with COPD may complain of tightness in the
      chest and constant fatigue. Because air has been gradually and
      continuously trapped in their lungs in increasing amounts, their chests
      often have a barrel-like appearance.
    </p>
    <h2>Asthma</h2>
    <hr />
    <div class="columns">
      <div class="flex-50">
        <p>
          Asthma ia an acute spams of the smaller air passages called
          bronchioles that is associated with excessive mucus production and
          spasm of the bronchilar muscles. It is a common but serious disease.
          Asthma is a reversible obstruction that is caused by a combination of
          smooth-muscle spasm (bronchospasm), mucus production, and edema.
          <strong>Status asthmaticus</strong> is a severe, prolonged asthmatic
          attack that cannot be resolved with conventional treatment. It is a
          dire medical emergency.
        </p>
        <p>
          Asthma produces a characteristic wheezing as the patient attempts to
          exhale through partially obstructed air passages; wheezing is
          indicative of a narrowed lower airway. These same air passages open
          easily during inspiration so that breathing appears relatively normal;
          the wheezing is heard only when they exhale. This wheezing may be so
          loud that you can hear it without a stethoscope, which is known as
          audible wheezing. Continuous wheezing occurs during inspiration and
          expiration and is generally diffuse, or heard throughout the lungs,
          not just over one particular lobe. In other cases, the airways are so
          blocked that no air movement is heard (a silent chest). In severe
          cases, the actual work of exhaling is very tiring, and cyanosis,
          respiratory arrest, or both may develop.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="flex-50">
        <img src="./images/chapter 17/chapter17 - bronchioles" />
        <p>
          Asthma affects people of all ages and is usually the result of an
          allergic reaction to an inhaled, ingested, or injected substance. It
          may also be induced by exercise, severe emotional stress, or
          respiratory infections.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most patients with asthma are familiar with their symptoms and know
          when an attack is imminent. Typically, they will have appropriate
          medication with them or at home. Listen carefully to what patients
          tell you; they often know exactly what they need.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Anaphylactic Reactions</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction. This is characterized by
      swelling of the airway and dilation of the blood vessels. This can
      otherwise be referred to as anaphylactic shock. This reaction may be
      associated with widespead hives, itching, signs of shock, and symptoms
      similar to asthma. If not treated airway swelling can become an airway
      obstruction. Most reactions take place 30 minutes after exposure to the
      allergen.
    </p>
    <h2>Sponatneous Pneumothorax</h2>
    <hr />
    <div class="columns">
      <div class="flex-50">
        <p>
          The "vacuum" in the plueral space keeps the lungs inflated. However
          when the suface of the lung is broken air is allowed to escape into
          the plueral cavity. This causes a loss of the vacuum pressure, causing
          the lung the collapse. When this occurs it is known as a pneumothorax.
          This condition is normally caused by trauma but can be caused by
          medical conditions as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sponatneous pneumothorax can occur in pateitns with chronic lung
          infections or people born with weak areas of the lung. Also patients
          with emphysema and asthma are at high risk, this is usually caused
          when the patient experiences severe coughing. Tall, thin, athletic
          males are also at a high risk while performing stenous activities.
        </p>
        <p>

          <strong>pleuritic chest pain</strong>, a stabbing pain on one side
          that is worse durnig breathing or with certain movements of the chest
          wall. You may note subcutaneous tissue while palpating the chest. If
          auscultated witha stethoscope you will note decreased or absent lung
          sounds on one side. Minor symptoms include pale, diaphoretic, and
          tachypneic. Severe symptoms include altered mental status, cyanosis,
          tachycardia, unilaterally decreased breath sounds, local
          hyperreasonance to percussion and subcutaneous emphysema.

    <h2>Pleural Effusion</h2>
    <hr />
    <div class="columns">
      <div class="flex-50">
        <p>
          A pleural effusion is a collection of fluid outside the lung on one or
          both sides of the chest. By compressing one or both lungs, it causes
          dyspneaCh. This fluid may collect in large volumes in response to any
          irritation, infection, heart failure, or cancer. Although it can build
          up gradually over days or even weeks, patients often report that their
          dyspnea began suddenly. Pleural effusions should be considered a
          possibility in any patient with lung cancer and shortness of breath.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you listen with a stethoscope to the chest of a patient with
          dyspnea resulting from pleural effusion, you will hear decreased
          breath sounds over the region of the chest where fluid has moved the
          lung away from the chest wall. These patients frequently feel better
          if they are sitting upright. Definitive care for the patient with a
          pleural effusion includes removing the fluid, a procedure that must be
          performed by a physician.

    <h2>Pulmonary Embolism</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      An <strong>embolus</strong> is anything in the circulatory system that
      moves from its point of orgin and travels to a distant site where it
      lodges, creating a perfusion disorder by obstructing subsequent blood flow
      in that area. This partial/full obstruction can cause deep vein stasis or
      stagnation of blood. Emboli are usually fragments of blood clots that
      break off and travel through the blood stream. They can also comprise of
      foreign bodies such as a piece of material from a catheter shear or bubble
      of air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pulmonary embolisms specifically are blood clots formed in a vein that
      breaks off and circulates through the venous system. The clot moves
      through the right side of the heart and into the pulmonary arety where it
      becomes lodged. This will limit or block exchange of oxygen and carbon
      dioxide in the blocked section.
    </p>
    <div>
      <img class="small" src="./images/chapter 17/pulmonary embolism.png" />
    </div>
    <p>
      Embolisms can cause for different reasons, such as platelet aggregation
      due to damage to the lining of the vessels as well as slow blood flow in
      the lower extremities. Patients who are bed ridden are at a higher risk.
      Some of other risks factors include: immobilzed fractures, recent
      surgeries, pregnancy, oral contraceptives, smoking, infection, cancer,
      sickle cell anemia, and prolonged inactivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pulmonary embolisms affect roughly 300,000 to 900,000 people in the United
      States each year.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Dyspnea</li>
      <li>Tachycardia</li>
      <li>Tachypnea</li>
      <li>Varying degrees of hypoxia</li>
      <li>Cyanosis</li>
      <li>Acute chest pain</li>
      <li>Hemoptysis (coughing up blood)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Patients who have this condition usually present with sudden onset of
      inspiratory chest pain, dyspnea, or nonproductive cough. If the
      obstruction blocks flow from the right side of the heart it can be fatal.
    </p>
    <h2>Obstruction of the Airway</h2>
    <hr />
    <div class="columns">
      <div class="flex-75">
        <p>
          An obstructed airway can result from aspirated vomit or foreign
          object. If a patient was eating food before becoming short of breath
          or unresponsive consider an obstruced airway
        </p>
        <p>
          Always consider upper airway obstruction from a foreign body first
          when a young child becomes short of breath. This is especially true of
          crawling babies, who might have swallowed and choked on a small
          object. Inflammation of the tonsils may also partially occlude the
          airway, creating an obstruction. Dysfunction of a tracheostomy may
          also create an upper airway obstruction, especially if plugged with
          mucus or other secretions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The obstruction may be in the lower airway, below the vocal cords.
          Trauma to the trachea may result in a crushing injury, fractured
          larynx, or edema that obstructs the lower airway. Obstruction may also
          be in the form of obstructive lung disease, mucus accumulation, or
          smooth muscle spasm. Edema also may be present when a patient has been
          exposed to toxic chemicals or superheated air, as in a structural
          fire.

    <h2>Enviornment/Industrial Exposure</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Many industrial accidents can result in inhalation injury of
      dyspnea.Pesticides, cleaning solutions, chemicals, chlorine, and other
      gases can accidentally be released and inhaled by employees.Sometimes
      chemicals such as ammonia and chlorine bleach are mixed and create a
      hazardous by-product. Carbon monoxide is another toxic, odorless, highly
      poisonous gas that is produced in industrial settings by vehicles,
      gasoline-powered tools, and heaters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The type of damage from the substance depends in large part on the water
      solubility of the toxic gas. Highly water-soluble gases such as ammonia
      will react with the moist mucous membranes of the upper airway and cause
      swelling and irritation. If the substance gets in the patient's eyes, they
      will also burn and feel inflamed and irritated. Less water-soluble gases
      such as phosgene and nitrogen dioxide may get deep into the lower airway,
      where they may cause pulmonary edema up to 24 hours later.
    </p>
    <h2>Cysitc Fibrosis</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <strong>Cystic fibrosis (CF)</strong> is a genetic disorder that affects
      the lungs and digestive system. In most children the disease tends to be
      fatal, but with recent treatments patient are unable to live in to their
      30's
    </p>
    <p>
      CF is caused by a defective gene, which makes it difficult for chloride to
      move through cells. This causes unusually high sodium loss and abnormally
      thick mucus secretions. The secretions in the lungs cause breathing
      difficulties and provide an ideal growing medium for bacteria, leaving the
      patient highly susceptible to infection. Ultimately, the lung damage from
      the condition results in lung disease, the primary cause of death in
      affected persons.
    </p>
    <p>
      In CF, the child's symptoms range from sinus congestion to wheezing and
      asthma-like complaints. The child may have a chronic cough that produces
      thick, heavy, discolored mucus. He or she may also present with tachypnea,
      shortness of breath, barrel chest, clubbed fingers, and cyanosis. The
      thick mucus may also collect in the intestines. The child often has
      dyspnea; this generally results in the parents calling EMS. Treat the
      child with suction and oxygen using age-appropriate adjuncts. Keep a keen
      eye out for respiratory insufficiency, signs of a respiratory infection,
      and intestinal blockage.
    </p>
    <p>
      CF often causes death in childhood because of chronic pneumonia secondary
      to the thick pathologic mucus in the airway. Adults with CF are
      predisposed to other medical conditions, including arthritis,
      osteoporosis, diabetes, and liver problems.
    </p>
    <h2>Age-Related Conditions</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Bronchiolitis</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Bronchiolitis is an inflammation of the bronchioles as a result o a viral
      infection. The most common source for this virus is RSV. This virus is
      most prominent in the late fall and winter. Infants and children younger
      than 2 years of age are mostly affected.
    </p>
    <p>
      The symptoms for this infection is hard to distinguish from those of
      asthma, although it is important to note that asthma is rare in children
      younger than 1 year of age; an infant with a first-time wheezing episode
      occurring in late fall or winter likely has bronchiolitis. Mild to
      moderate retractions, tachypnea, diffuse wheezing, diffuse crackles, and
      mild hypoxia are characteristic findings. As with asthma, a sleepy or
      obtunded patient or one with severe retractions, diminished breath sounds,
      or moderate to severe hypoxia (oxygen saturation <90%) is in danger of
      respiratory failure and requires immediate ventilatory support and
      transport.
    </p>
    <h3>Respiratory Syncytial Virus</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
      This illness caues infection in the lungs and breathing passages which
      results in other serious illnesses such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia.
      RSV is highly contagious and can be spread through droplets. The virus is
      able to survive on surfaces including the hands and clothing. RSV also
      causes upper respiratory infections and typical asthma symptoms in adults
      and geriatric patients.
    </p>
    <h3>Croup</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Croup is caused by inflammation and swelling of the pharynx, larynx, and
      trachea. This disease is often secondary to an acute viral infection of
      the upper respiratory tract and is typically seen in children between ages
      6 months and 3 years. It is easily passed between children.
    </p>
    <p>
      The disease starts with a cold, cough, and a low-grade fever that develop
      over 2 days. The hallmark signs of croup are stridor and a seal-bark
      cough, which signal a substantial narrowing of the air passage of the
      trachea that may progress to marked obstruction. Peak seasonal outbreaks
      of this disease occur in the late fall and during the winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Croup is rarely seen in adults because their breathing passages are larger
      and can accommodate the inflammation and mucus production without
      producing symptoms. The airways of adults are wider, and the supporting
      tissue is firmer than in children.
    </p>
    <p class="h h-red">
      Croup often responds well to the administration of humidified oxygen.
    </p>
    <h3>Epiglottitis</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
      This life-threatening inflammatory disease of the epiglottis, the small
      flap of tissue at the back of the throat that protects the larynx and
      trachea. This disease is usually caused by a bacterial infection. Although
      this disease can effect any age group it is most prevelant in children.
      The vaccine <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> has decreased the incidence of
      this disease.
    </p>
    <p>
      This disease will develop rapidly and patients will normally present with
      a tripod position and be drooling. You may note stridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      In adult patients that have other health issues such as diabetes can have
      difficult in fighting off the disease. Acute epiglottitis in adult or
      geriatric patients can be life-threatening. Deterioration can occur
      quickly in these patients.
    </p>
    <h3>Pneumonia</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
      This disorder is caused by an infection of the lung parenchyma, which is
      the tissue of the lung itsel. It is the eighth leading cause of death in
      the United States. It is also not a single disease but a group of specific
      infections.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pneumonia presents as a localized infection in the lungs that may cause
      atelectasis, or alveolar collapse. If not treated promptly, the infection
      may become systemic, resulting in sepsis and septic shock. Typical
      findings with pneumonia include an acute onset of fever and chills,
      productive cough with purulent (thick) sputum, pleuritic chest pain, and
      excessive mucus causing pulmonary consolidation that may be detected by
      auscultation in the form of rales or rhonchi.

      <h3>Aerosol Therapy</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>Aerosol treatments are used for delivering medications such as bronchodilators. Aerosol delivers liquid medication in the form of a fine mist. The omptial flow of oxygen is roughly 6 L/min. </p>
      <p>In home aerosol treaments run off small air compressors. However in an ambulance these treaments run of an oxygen tank. This means that a patient will recieve 30% to 40 of oxygen via the aerosol treament, which is more than 21% greater than room air. </p>
      <p>There are multiple ways to administer aerosolizing treaments be that a mouthpiece (pipe), face mask, blow-by technique, or tracheostomy collor. </p>
      <h3>Metered-Dose Inhalers</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>A <strong>Metered-Dose Inhaler (MDI)</strong> is a small device containg a spray canister that administers a bronhodilator or corticosteriods in a home setting. Remember to document any doses patient took prior to EMS arrival.</p>
      <p>An addon device that can be used with MDIs is a <strong>spacer</strong>. This device allows more medication devliered as well as allowing the patient to not worry about coinciding their breaths with the discharge of the inhaler. However there are some important things to note such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mist from the MDI must enter the lungs</li>
        <li>Don't allows patient to blow into the spacer</li>
        <li>Spacers sound like harmonica-like sound if the patient sucks too hard</li>
        <li>After inhalaing patient should try to hold their breath to allow medication to absorb</li>
        <li>Make sure the inhaler contains medication</li>
        <li>Keep spacer and canister holder clean</li>
        <li>After corticosteriod use patients should rinse mouth out with water or mouthwash</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Dry-Powder Inhalers</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>Some respiratory medications are stored in a fine powder. Several common corticosteroids and slow-acting bronchodilators are often dispensed by this means. Each time the device is opened, the small plastic blister that holds a dose is rotated into position. The patient then pushes a small lever to puncture the blister, presses the disk to his or her lips over the opening, and inhales deeply to suck the powder out of the device. These devices are reasonably convenient and easy to use, but they are rarely used during emergency care.</p>
