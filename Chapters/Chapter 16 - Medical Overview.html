    <h2>Types of Medical Emergencies</h2>
    <p>
      There are a variety of medical emergencies that someone may experience. A
      respiratory emergency may be caused by trouble breathing or when the
      patient is unable to perfuse oxygen suffiecently. Some dieseases that
      could cause respiratory issues are asthma, emphysema, or chronic
      bronchitis. Cardiac emergencies are caused by issues within the
      circulatory system. Some common causes are acute myocardial infarction
      (AMI) or heart failure. Neurological emergencies involve the brain and
      could be caused by seizures, stroke, syncope. Gastrointestinal emergencies
      can be caused by appendicitis, diverticulitis, or pancreatitis.

    <h1 class="bg-red">Patient Assessment</h1>
    <p>
      During an assessment of a patient experiencing a medical emergency the
      focus is to determine the <strong>nature of illness (NOI)</strong>, symptoms, and the
      chief complaint. Remember to take the appropriate steps during patient
      assesssment, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Scene size-up</li>
      <li>Primary assessment</li>
      <li>History taking</li>
      <li>Secondary assessment</li>
      <li>Reassessment</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="bg-blue">Scene Size-Up</h2>
    <p>
      Even though medical emergencies have a less likely hood of having hazards
      than trauma scenes there is still potential for there to be hazards. One
      important thing to note is that some medical emergencies could be caused
      by the hazard. In some instances substance abuser could be located in
      dangerous locations. Remember to follow stand precautions. The first thing
      to do once you've determined the scene is safe is to determine your number
      of patients, evaluate signs and symptoms, and determine the NOI. This will
      give you an **index of suspicion** on the underlying or unseen injuries or
      illnesses.
    </p>
    <h2 class="bg-light-red">Primary Survey</h2>
    <p>
      Forming a general impression of a medical impression is one of the first
      things that is done when making patient contact. Assessing AVPU, ABCDEs
      and life threats is good way to measure how life threatning the current
      illness is.

                The followig list is a good indicator for patients that have serious
                conditions and require rapid transport.

    <h2 class="bg-gray">History Taking</h2>
    <p>When dealing with medical patients obtaining history is vital to detereming what is wrong or what is causing the problem. You can investigate the <strong>Nature of illness (NOI)</strong> by asking questions about the chief complaint. Make sure to obtain SAMPLE and OPQRST</p>
    <div class="columns" style="width: 100%;">
        <div class="flex-50">
            <h3>SAMPLE</h3>
            <ul>

            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>Record any findings you find. If a patient has a list for their medications try to keep that with the patient as it will help with continuity of care. If a patient is taking a lot of medications make sure ot ask if they are compliant. If the patient is unresponsive try to obtain information from family, friends, or bystanders. Sometimes looking for evidence around a scene may help you clue into what is the problem.</p>
    <h2 class="bg-purple">Secondary Assessment</h2>
    <p>During this assessment you want to identify any symptoms of the present illness. Depending on your patient will determine how you go about your assessment. If you have an unresponsive or patient with life threatning illness you may not have the time to perform a secondary assessment. If a patient is responsive they may not require as an indepth assessment as someone who is unresponsive. Obtaining a baseline set of vitals is important as this will allow you determine if the patient vitals are abnormal from their usual. This tasks can often be completed by your partner while you obtain history. </p>
    <h2 class="bg-orange">Reassessment</h2>
    <p>This phase usually take place during transport. It consists of retaking vitals, repeating your primary assessment. This is also a good time to review any treatments that have been done and deteremine if they are helping or not.</p>
    <h2>Scene-Time</h2>
    <p>Scene-time will vary depending on the acuity and type of patient you have. For a non life-threatning medical patient you may spend longer on scene obtaining information so that it can be given to the hospital than a life-threatening trauma patient who needs advanced care. One important thing to note is critical patients need rapid transport. For these patients scene time should be 10 minutes or less</p>
    <h1 class="bg-dark-red">Infectious Disease</h1>
    <h2>General Assessment Principles</h2>
    <h2>General Management Principles</h2>
    <p>When treating a patient with a suspected infectious disease also focus on the life-threatning issues first. This includes any issues with airway, breathing, or circulation. </p>
    <h2>Epidemic and Pandemic Condsiderations</h2>
    <p>An <strong>epidemic</strong> is when a new disease exceeds the expected numbers from previous experience. A <strong>pandemic</strong> is a global outbreak of a disease.</p>

        <h1 class="bg-dark-red">Common or Serious Communicable Diseases</h1>
        <p><strong>Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV)</strong> was first discovered in the late 1970s. Roughly 1.2 million people in the United States are infected with the virus, 1 in 8 people do not know they have it. There has been a 19% decline of new diagnoses from 2005 to 2014. Gay and bisexual men account for the majority of the new diagnoses.</p>
        <p>Infection from HIV is only through deposit on the mucous membrane or into the bloodstream. HIV will envelope infected cells and attack the immune system and organs. This causes the immune system to be ineffective in fighting off other diseases. The timeline for HIV infection is usually 4 to 6 weeks from the time of infection for the virus to enevlope a cell. Although once the process starts it only takes 7 days for the infection to fully envelope a cell.</p>
        <p>HIV infections tend to show no symptoms. Although for those who do show signs and symptoms the symptoms are usually as follows: acute febrile illness, malaise, fatigue, sore throat, swollen spleen, and lymph glands, headache, weight loss, and possibly rash. After the inital infection enlarged lymph nodes are present. </p>
        <p><strong>Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)</strong> is the end-stage process of HIV. These patients are extremely vulnerable to bacterial, viral, and fungal infections. Prehospital management of HIV/AIDS is limited. Supporting the airway, breathing as needed. Obtaining IV access and adminstering fluids if neccessary.</p>
        <p>During these encounter it is important to take standard precautions. AEMTs can still be exposed in the following ways: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Blood is splashed or sprayed into your eyes, nose, mouth, open sore or cut</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Exposure from the eye, nose, or mouth is only 1 in 1,000</li>
                <li>Exposure from a cut is 1 in 300</li>
            </ul>
            <li>A needle you used on a patient breaks your skin. Although the risk of exposure is only 1 in 300 this is the most dangerous form of exposure</li>
            <li>Broken glass at a MVC or other incident penetrates your glove and skin which may have had blood from a patient on.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Many patients who are infected with HIV do not show any symptoms. This is why it is important to always wear gloves when coming into contact with any patient. If you are exposed you must notify your infectious disease officer as soon as possible. If the patient is HIV positive and you are exposed then you will need to undergo a prophlyactic treatment as soon as possible to prevent becoming infected.</p>
        <h2>Influenza</h2>
        <p><strong>Influenza</strong>, otherwise known as the flu is a type of respiratory disease that has mutated to infect humans. While normally not deadly anyone with chronic medical conditions, compromised immune systems, as well as the very young and old are susceptible to complications. Transmission is through direct contact with nasal secretions and aersolized droplets from coughing and sneezing by infected people</p>
        <p>The H1N1 virus that was identified in 2009 as the swine flu is a specific form of the influenze. The H1N1 virus is a more deadly virus that the flu. One positive thing that resulted fromt he swine flu is the publics greater awareness of how it was spread, this allowed people to take the proper precautions to not become infected</p>
        <p>As an AEMt there is limited amount of treatments you can do for someone with the influenze. One thing is provide oxygen if neccessary. Obtaining IV access and giving a 20-mL/kg bolus of a iostonic crystalloid solution may help as influenze patients can quickly become dehydrated.</p>
        <p>Taking the proper precautions when treating a patient that has been diagnosed or suspected of having the influenze is an important step in not becoming infected. Getting your flu shot is a good starting point, placing a surgical mask on your patient and donning a respirator is important to protect you and your patient</p>
        <h2>Hepatitis</h2>
        <p>Hepatitis is referred to as inflammation (and often infection) of the liver. This can be caused by viruses or toxins. Some of the complications from heaptitis are scarring of the liver, liver cancer, and liver failure. Of the three types of viral hepatitis, hepatitis C accounted for the greatest number of deaths and highest mortality rate. Roughly 5 deaths per 100,000 in 2014.</p>
        <p>Depending on the severity the patient may be asymptomiac or have a variety of symptoms. Some early signs include loss of appetite, vomiting, fever, fatigue, sore throat, cough, and muscle and joint pain. <strong>jaundice (yellow eyes and skin)</strong> and right upper quadrant abdominal pain develop several weeks later. Acute liver failure is a fatal but rare occurance that could happen when infected with viral hepatitis. When talking about the severity of toxin-induced hepatitis it usually depends on the amount of the toxin that was absorbed and the duration of exposure. Toxin-induced hepatitis is not contagious.</p>
        <p>Management for these patients is usually supportive. Maintaining an airway, giving oxygen or assisting ventilations as needed. Establishing an IV and adminstering fluids if needed.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately there is no way to tell which patients have contagious or non-contagious forms of hepatitis. Below is a table where you can guage your risk of exposure when treating patients with hepatitis</p>

            <p><strong>Virulence</strong> is the ability of a pathogen to produce disease.</p>
            <h2>Herpes Simplex</h2>
            <p><strong>Herpes simplex</strong> is a common virus strain carried by humans. More than 85% of people carrying the virus are asymptomatic, but symptomatic infections cause eruptions of tiny fluid-filled blisters called vesicles that often appear on the lips or genitals. Herpes simplex can also cause more serious illnesses like pneumonia and meningitis in the very young, very old, and immunocompromised patients. The primary mode of infection is through close personal contact, so standard precautions are generally sufficient to prevent spread to or from health care workers.</p>
            <h2>Syphilis</h2>
            <p>Although syphilis is commonly thought of as a sexually transmitted disease, it is also a bloodborne disease. There is a small risk for transmission through a contaminated needlestick injury or direct blood-to-blood contact. The initial infection with syphilis produces a lesion called a chancre. Chancres are most commonly located in the genital region.</p>
            <h2>Meningitis</h2>
            <p><strong>Meningitis</strong> is a inflammation of the meningeal coverins of the brain and spinal cord. Common signs and symptoms are a fever, headache, stiff neck, and altered mental status. This disease is caused by viruses or bacteria, however are not contagious. <strong>Meningococcal meningitis</strong> is highly contagious. This form of the virus colonized the human nose and throat and rarely causes an acute infection. However when it does this can be fatal. Patients with this disease usually present with red blotches on their skin, fever, and nuchal (nape of the neck) rigidity. It is important to note that some patients with non-contagious meningitis can also have red blotches.</p>
            <p>The only way to determine what type of meningitis a patient has is through lab work. Therefore it is important to take the neccessary steps and precautions when coming into contact with these patients. It is important to contact your employer health representative to report that you may have come into contact with a patient who is infected with meningitis. Many states consider this reportable and will follow up with you to notify you if your patient was diagnosed with meningitis. If it is confirmed you were exposed you may need to have a prophylactic treatment.</p>
            <h2>Tuberculosis</h2>
            <p>Tuberculosis is a disease that usually strikes the lungs. However if the disease involves the brain or kidneys then it is only slightly contagious. Disease that occurs shortly after infection is called primary tuberculosis. This infection is usually not serious, except in infant. After this infection the disease is usually rendered dormant by the patient's immune system. However the disease can reactivate after decades, in these cases it is must more difficult to treat because the disease has had time to become resistant to antibiotics.</p>
            <p>This disease is normally difficult to distinguish from other diseases, but one thing that is usually present in all patients is a cough. Therfore respiratory tuberculosis is the only contagious form because it is spread through airborn transimssion. The droplet nuclei is the contagious part of the droplet, this nuclei will can remain suspended in air long after the droplet has evaporated. If protected from UV light these particles can remain alive for decades. An important thing to note is that these droplets can pass through surgical masks, the only true respiratory protection is with a N95 or HEPA mask. If the patient is having respiratory distress a nonrebreathing mask is ideal as it allows you to oxygenate your patient while providing a barrier to contain the droplets. </p>
            <p>If you are exposed to a patient who is found to have pulmonary tuberculosis, you will be given a tuberculin skin test. This simple skin test determines whether a person has been infected with M tuberculosis. A positive result means that exposure has occurred; it does not mean that the person has active tuberculosis. It takes at least 6 weeks for the bacteria to show up in the laboratory test. So if you are tested for the disease within a few weeks of the exposure and your results are positive, this outcome means that you were exposed to tuberculosis at an earlier time from somebody else. You will probably never identify the source. Most transmissions occur silently, so it is necessary that you have tuberculin skin tests regularly. If the infection is found before you become ill, preventive therapy is almost 100% effective. Usually, a daily dose of the medication isoniazid will prevent the development of active infection.</p>
            <h2>Pertussis</h2>
            <p><strong>Pertussis</strong>, also known as whooping cough is an airborne disease. This disease was normally found in children younger than 6 years of age, although now it becoming common in adults who immunity has decreased. Symptoms include a fever and a "whoop" sound that occurs when the patient tries to inhale after a coughing attack.</p>
            <p>The best way to prevent infection from pertussis is to be vaccinated with a diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine. Providers who have previously received this vaccine should make sure they are up-to-date with a booster. For added protection, place a mask on the patient and on yourself.</p>
            <h2>Methicillin-Resistant Staphlococcus Aureus</h2>
            <p><strong>Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)</strong> is a bacterium that causes infections and is resistant to many antibiotics. <strong>Nosocomial (acquired when receiving health care)</strong> infections with MRSA are believed to be transmitted from patient to patient via the unwashed hands of health care providers. Studies have shown that 1% to 5% of health care providers carry MRSA in their nares.10 The pathogen can subsequently be transferred to skin and other areas of the body through a break in the skin. Surfaces contaminated with MRSA do not seem to be important in transmission. Factors that increase the risk for developing MRSA include antibiotic therapy, prolonged hospital stays, a stay in an intensive care or burn unit, and exposure to an infected patient.</p>
            <p>The incubation period for MRSA appears to be between 5 and 45 days. The communicable period varies, as patients who have active infection may carry MRSA for months. MRSA results in soft-tissue infections. Its signs and symptoms may involve localized skin abscesses, and sepsis may be found in older patients with the infection.</p>
            <p>To prevent MRSA transmission, use standard precautions (gloves and good handwashing technique) when in contact with patient wounds and nonintact skin. If you are in direct contact with wound drainage but your skin is intact, no exposure will occur. If you have a true exposure, no postexposure treatment is recommended. The incident must still be documented, however.</p>
            <h2>New and Emerging Diseases</h2>
            <p>Newly recognized diseases, such as those caused by Hantavirus (a rare but deadly virus transmitted through rodent urine and droppings) and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (a common cause of pediatric diarrhea in developing countries), are being reported. These diseases are not transmitted from person to person directly; rather, they are carried by a vehicle, such as food, or a vector, such as rodents.</p>
            <h3>West Nile Virus</h3>
            <p>Although not a newly discovered illness, West Nile virus has caused some concern in the past. The virus’ vector, the mosquito, affects humans and birds. The virus is tracked by tests done on birds suspected of being killed by the virus. These diseases are not communicable and do not pose a risk to you during patient care.</p>
            <h3>Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome</h3>
            <p>A virus that has caused significant concern in the recent past is <strong>severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)</strong>. SARS is a serious, potentially life-threatening viral infection caused by a recently discovered family of viruses. SARS usually starts with flulike symptoms, which may progress to pneumonia, respiratory failure, and, in some cases, death. The SARS virus strain probably spread from Guangdong province in southern China to Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan. Canada experienced a significant outbreak in the Toronto area in 2003. SARS is thought to be primarily transmitted by close person-to-person contact. Most cases have involved people who lived with or cared for a person with SARS or who had exposure to contaminated secretions from a patient with SARS.</p>
            <h3>Avian Flu</h3>
            <p>Avian (bird) flu is caused by a virus (designated as H5N1) that occurs naturally in the bird population. This virus is carried in the intestinal tract of wild birds and does not usually cause illness. However, in domestic bird populations (eg, chickens, ducks, and turkeys), it is very contagious. Birds acquire the illness from contact with contaminated excretions or surfaces that are contaminated with excretions. If an infected bird is used for food and is cooked, it does not pose a risk to those who eat it.</p>

            <h2>Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus</h2>
            <p>Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a virus most commonly found in bats and camels living in the Middle East. The first human case of MERS-CoV was discovered in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. While most clusters of human infections are found in the Middle East, cases of MERS-CoV have also been reported in Europe and the United States. Common patient symptoms include high fever, cough, muscle aches, vomiting, and diarrhea. In some cases, renal failure, respiratory failure, and death have been reported. There is presently no cure or vaccine for this virus. If you suspect your patient might have MERS-CoV, place a surgical mask on him or her and notify the receiving facility.</p>
            <h2>Ebola</h2>
            <p>The incubation period for ebola is 6 to 12 days after exposure. However symptoms may not appears for up to 21 days. The symptoms include: water diarrehea, vomiting, fever, body aches, and bleeding. Fatality rate is 70% if intensive care is not rendered promptly</p>
            <p>If you suspect the patient may have this condition, place a surgical mask on him or her and follow PPE precautions as outlined by local protocols and the CDC. Immediately notify the receiving facility that the patient may have or may have been exposed to the Ebola virus.</p>
            <h2>Zika Virus</h2>
            <p><strong>Zika</strong> virus is a vector-borne infection first noted in the United States in mid-2015. Transmission is through the <i>Aedes aegypti</i> mosquito. Multiple countires in the Caribbean and South Americas is where the virus is most prealent. There is currently no vaccine for the virus. Although most people show no signs of being infected, those who do show signs typically present with: fever, rash, join pain, and conjunctivitis. Other symptoms may include muscle pain and headache. Symptoms are usually mild and last from several days to a week. Infection can be confirmed through urine or blood test.</p>
            <p>Pregnant women are most susceptible as becoming infected with virus poses risks to the fetus. Some birth defects have been noted such as microcephaly (the head is small because the brain has not properly developed). It is possible for there to be human-to-human transmission through sexual contact.</p>
            <p>Although Zika has not been documented to be transmitted through blood all blood donations are sceened for the Zika virus. Some good questions to ask patients to help determine if they've been possibly infected is to ask travel related questions such as:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Where did you recently travel?</li>
              <li>Did you receive any vaccinations before your trip?</li>
              <li>Were you exposed to any infectious diseases?</li>
              <li>Is there anyone else in your travel party who is sick?</li>
              <li>Which types of food did you eat?</li>
              <li>What was your source of drinking water?</li>
            </ul>
