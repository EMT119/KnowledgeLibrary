    <h1>Chapter 40 - Vehicle Extrication, Special Rescue, and Hazardous Materials</h1>
    <h1 class="bg-dark-red">Fundamentals of Extrication</h1>
    <p><b>Entrapment</b> is when someone is caught within a closed area with no way our or has a limb or body part trapped. There are 10 phases to the extrication process:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preparation</li>
        <li>En-route to the scene</li>
        <li>Arrival and scene size-up</li>
        <li>Hazard control</li>
        <li>Support operations</li>
        <li>Gaining access</li>
        <li>Emergency medical care</li>
        <li>Removal of the patient</li>
        <li>Transfer of the patient</li>
        <li>Termination</li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>Situation awareness</b> allows you to recognize and understand potential threats and react proactively to avoid negative consequences. One thing to keep in mind when you are on the scene of an MVC is to only use essential warning lights as too many lights can distract drivers.</p>
    <p>One of the important things taught early on is <b>scene size-up</b>. This step is to allow you to gather information and assess risk when approaching a scene. For instance some hazards to look for when on-scene of an MVC is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Downed power lines</li>
        <li>Leaking fuel or other substances</li>
        <li>Smoke or fire</li>
        <li>Broken glass</li>
        <li>The mechanism of injury</li>
        <li>Trapped or ejected patients</li>
        <li>The number of patients and vehicle involved</li>
    </ul>
