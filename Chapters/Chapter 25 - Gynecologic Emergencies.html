      The female reproductive organs include genitalia, uterus, vagina,
      fallopian tubes, ovaries, and perineum.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Ovaries</strong> are almond-shaped organs that are on each side of
      the upper pelvic cavity. Ovaries serve two functions. They help produce
      ova and estrogen and progesterone. The corpus luteum (small yellow
      endocrine structre that develops within a rupture ovarian follicle) screte
      the hormones.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Fallopian tubes</strong> are ducts that extend from the uterus and
      terminate near the ovary on each side.

    <h2>Physiology Review</h2>
    <p>
      Every month hormones rise and stimulate developed of eggs in the ovaries,
      which causes enometrium of the urerus to thicken in anticipation of
      implantation of a fertilized egg. If implantation occurs menses is
      suspended until the pregnancy ends. If implantation does <b>NOT</b> occur
      then <strong>menstruation</strong> begins. Menstruation is the shedding of
      the uterine lining that occurs roughly every 28 days. These cycles usually
      last 4 to 6 days with blood loss around 25 to 60 mL. The inital onset of
      menstruation is known as <strong>menarche</strong> which occurs during
      puberty. <strong>Menopause</strong> is the cessation of menstruation and
      ovarian function, generally occuring between the ages of 45 and 55 years.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Premenstrual syndrome (PMS)</strong> is a group of symptoms that
      occurs 7 to 14 days before the onset of menstrual flow and will typically
      subside once the flow begins. PMS will affect 20 to 30% of premenopausal
      women, these symptoms can be debilitating. Certain things can exacerbate
      these symptoms such as: stress, diet, alcohol consumption, prescription
      and nonprescription drug use. The main form of treatment for these
      patients is administering oral or IV glucose if glucose levels fall. As
      well as administering <strong>analgesics (painkillers)</strong> or
      <strong>anxiolytics (anti-anxiety)</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      In some cases women may experience abdominal pain or cramping 2 weeks
      before the beginning of menses. These pains and accompanying symptoms are
      collectively called <i>mittelschmerz (german word for middle pain)</i>,
      this affects approximately 20% of women. This pain usually is not severe
      and lasts from a few minutes to 48 hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Amenorrhea</strong> is the absscence of cessation of menses.
      Although many factors can cause this the most common cause is pregnancy.
      It can also be caused by exercise, emotional problems, or extreme stress.
    </p>
    <h1 class="bg-dark-red">Pathyophysiology</h1>
    <p>
      Many disorders can lead to gynecologic emergencies. Some of these
      disorders include: acute or chronic infections, hemorrhage, rupture of a
      cyst, and rupture of an ectopic pregnancy.

        <h2>Pelvic Inflammatory Disease</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          <strong>Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)</strong> is an acute or
          chronic infection of the upper reproductive organs. This is caused by
          organisms entering the vagina during sexual activity and migrating
          through the opening of the cervix and into the uterine cavity.
          Symptoms for this are usually as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sepsis</li>
          <li>Abscess formation</li>
          <li>Generalized peritonitis</li>
          <li>Infertility</li>

        <h2>Sexually Transmitted Disease</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Unfortunately there is not much you can do as an Advanced EMT for
          these patients except for placing the patient in position of comfort
          and providing supportive care.
        </p>
        <b style="font-size: 1.25rem"
          >Below are some of the diseases that you may run into.</b
        >
        <h3>Bacterial Vaginosis</h3>
        <p>
          This infection is most common in women ages 15 to 44. In these
          infections bacteria in the vagina is replaced by overgrowth of other
          bacterial forms. Symptoms can include: itching, burning, or pain. It
          may also be accompanied by a "fishy", foul-smelling discharge.
          Pregnancy complications can occur from this infection with premature
          babies or babies with low birth weight. If this infection is untreated
          it can lead to more serious infections or result in PID.
        </p>
        <h3>Chancroid</h3>
        <p>
          This disease is caused by the bacterium called
          <i>Haemophilus dureyi</i>. It is highly contagious but curable
          disease. This disease causes
          <strong>ulcers (painful sores)</strong> usually on the genitals.
          Swollen, painful lymph glands or inguinal buboes are usually present
          as well. Women can be asymptomatic and therefore unaware they have the
          disease.
        </p>
        <h3>Chlamydia</h3>
        <p>
          Caused by the bacterium called <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i>. It is one
          of the most common STDs in the United States. Symptoms are usually
          mild or absent, some women may experience lower abdominal pain, low
          back pain, nausea, fever, pain during sexual intercourse, and/or
          bleeding between menstrual periods. If the infection spread to the
          rectum and lead to rectal pain, discharge, or bleeding. If untreated
          it can progress to PID. In some but rare cases it can cause arthritis,
          which is usually accompanied by skin lesions and inflammation of the
          eye and urethra also known as <strong>Reiter syndrome</strong>
        </p>
        <h3>Cytomegalovirus (CMV)</h3>
        <p>
          This disease is a member of the <i>herpesvirus</i>. It is a common
          viral infection but has no cure. Although it can lie dormant in the
          body for years, in its active stages CMV can produce the following
          symptoms: prolong high fever, chills, headache, malaise, extreme
          fatigue, and an enlarged spleen. Individuals with immune disorders,
          those receiving chemotherapy, and pregnant women can haver serious
          complications develop such as fever, pneumonia, liver infection, and
          anemia. Newborns who acquire CMV are susceptible to lung conditions,
          blood conditions, liver conditions, swollen glands, rash, and poor
          weight gain.
        </p>
        <h3>Genital Herpes</h3>
        <p>
          Infection cuased by the <i>herpes simplex virus</i>. This infection
          usually affects the genitals, buttocks, or anal area. There are two
          types
        </p>
        <div class="columns">
          <div class="flex-50">
            <h4>Type I</h4>
            <hr />
            <p>
              Most common form. Infects the mouth and lips which causes cold
              sores or "fever" blisters. It can also produce sores on the
              genitals
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="flex-50">
            <h4>Type II</h4>
            <hr />
            <p>
              This form is a more serious infection. It can affect the mouth but
              is primarly known as the primary cause of genital herpes
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          In active herpes the symptoms will usually appear within 2 weeks of
          primary infeciton and can last for several weeks. Symptoms can include
          tingling or sores near the area where the virus entered the body
          (genital or rectal area, buttocks, thighs, or parts of the body where
          there is broken skin. In women the sores can present inside the vagina
          or on the cervic or urinary passageway.
        </p>
        <p>
          Small red bumps will develop into blisters and become itchy, painful
          sores that can develop a crust and heal without leaving a scar. Other
          symptoms that can occur are fever, muscle aches and pains, headche,
          dysuria, vaginal discharge, and swollen glands in the groin area.
        </p>
        <h3>Gonorrhea</h3>
        <p>
          Cuased by the <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> bacterium. This bacterium
          grows and multiples rapidly in warm, moist areas in the reproductive
          tract. Some placeds that are good areas for this to occur are the
          cervic, uterus, and fallopian tubes in women, and urethra in both men
          and women.
        </p>
        <p>
          Symptoms in men are generally severe. Symptoms start to appear 2 to 10
          days after exposure. Women may be asymptomatic until the infection has
          spread to other parts of the reproductive system. However when
          symptoms do appear they are dysuria (painful urination), yellow or
          bloody vaginal discharge (usually with a foul odor).
        </p>
        <p>
          Severe infections may present with cramping and abdominal pain,
          nausea, vomiting, and bleeding between menstrual periods. When these
          symptoms appear it means the infection has progressed to PID. If the
          infection starts/moves to the rectum then anal discharge, itching, and
          painful bowel movements with fecal blood spotting will present. If the
          method of infection is through oral sex then it is called
          <i>gonococcal pharyngitis</i>. The symptoms associtated with this form
          of the infection are generally mild with symptoms presenting as
          painful or difficult swallowing, sore throat, swollen lymph glands,
          fever, headache, and nasal congestion. If this is not treated then it
          can enter the bloodstream and spread throughout the body, when it
          spreads to the brain it is known as <i>disseminated gonococcemia</i>
        </p>
        <h3>Genital Warts</h3>
        <p>
          Caused by the <strong>human papillomarvirus (HPV)</strong>. This is
          the most common form of STDs, and it is estimated that 79 millon
          people are infected and roughly 14 million new cases will occur every
          year. Some of the infected individuals have no symptoms but other will
          generally will have growths develop in the vagina, vulva, cervix, or
          the penis and scrotum in men. HPV can be contributing cause of cancer.
          In pregnant women wart can develop that could impede urination or
          obstruct the birth canal. If this virus is passed to the fetus then
          <i>laryngeal papillomatosis</i> (throat warts that block the airway)
          may develop which is potentially life-threatening.
        </p>
        <h3>Syphilis</h3>
        <p>
          Caused by the bacterium <i>treponema pallidum</i>. This disease is
          known as the <b>"great imitator"</b> as it can be difficult to
          distinguish it from other diseases. Transmission can occur through
          direct contact with open sores which may be anywhere on the body but
          usually are located on the genitals, anus, rectum, lips, or mouth. It
          is important to remeber that a person can remain asymptomatic for
          years. The disease can be split into three stages.
        </p>
        <h4>Primary Stage</h4>
        <p>
          This is when a single sore otherwise known as a
          <strong>chancre</strong> develops. This sore is generally painless and
          is small, firm, and round. It will go away after 3 to 6 weeks, after
          this the disease will have progressed to the second stage.
        </p>
        <h4>Secondary Stage</h4>
        <p>
          This stage usually has mucous membrane lesions and rash develop. The
          rash does not generally itch. It is usaully accompanied by other
          symptoms such as: fever, swollen lymph glands, sore throat, patchy
          hair loss, headache, weight loss, muscle ache, and fatigue. Although
          the symptoms will resolve without treatment it will also allow the
          disease to progress to the last stage.
        </p>
        <h4>Tertiary Stage</h4>
        <p>
          At this point in the disease it will start to attack the brain,
          nerves, eyes, heart, blood vessels, liver, bones, and joints.
          <span class="h h-red"
            >It can take years for the damage to become evident</span
          >. Some other things the disease can cause are paralysis, numbness,
          dementia, gradual blindness, and difficulty coordinating muscle moves.
          In pregnant women their babies can be stillborn, blind,
          developmentally delayed, or die shortly after birth
        </p>
        <h3>Trichomoniasis</h3>
        <p>
          This is caused by the protozoan parasite called
          <i>Trichomonas vaginalis</i>. The parasite is transmitted through
          sexual contact. Individuals may be asymptomatic or may have frothy,
          yellow-green vaginal discharge with a strong odor. During intercourse
          these individuals can expereience discomfort as well as irritation,
          itching, lower abdominal pain, or dysuria. Symptoms typically appear 5
          to 28 days after exposure. This infection can cause low birth weight
          or premature babies in pregnancy, as well as the increased
          susceptibility to HIV infection.
        </p>
        <h3>Vaginal Yeast Infections</h3>
        <p>Caused by <i>Candida albicans fungus</i>. This generally occurs</p>
