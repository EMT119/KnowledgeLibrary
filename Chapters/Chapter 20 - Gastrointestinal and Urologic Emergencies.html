    <h1 class="bg-dark-red">Pathophysiology</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Acute abdomen</strong> is a medical term that is used to refer to
      the sudden onset of abdominal pain. This usually indicates the irriation
      of the <strong>peritoneum</strong>, the thin membrane that lines the
      abdominal cavity. This condition is known as <strong>peritonitis</strong>.
      This condition can be caused by infection, penetrating abdominal injuries,
      blunt injuries that are severe enough to damage abdominal organs. Clinical
      signs for this are abdominal tenderness and distention.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important to remember that urologic pain is usually referred pain.
      This means that pain from an organ may be interpretted as pain in the
      shoulder. This is caused from the two sepearate nervous systems coming
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      During normal digestion the intestine move in a wave like pattern known as
      <strong>peristalsis</strong>. However when paralysis
      <strong>(ileus)</strong> will cause the stomach be unable to empty into
      the intestine. This causes gas and feces to build up and cause abdominal
      distention. If this happens the only way the stomach is able to empty
      itself is by vomiting <strong>(emesis)</strong>. This is why nausea and
      vomiting is usually associated with peritonitis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soemtimes peritonitis can be caused by loss of body fluid into the
      abdominal cavity. This shift of fluid decreases the circulating blood
      volume. Overtime this can cause hypovolemic shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patient's with
      <strong>diverticulitis, cholecysitis, or appendicitis</strong> may or may
      not have fever. Appendicitis usually will not present with a fever until
      the appendix ruptures.

      Some condition can lead to <strong>urinary retention</strong> which is the
      incomplete emptying of the bladder. Some of these are conditions are as
      follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Kidney stones</li>
      <li>Benign prostate hypertrophy</li>
      <li>Urethral obstructions</li>
      <li>Urinary tract infections</li>
      <li>Nerve damage</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 class="bg-dark-red">Causes of Acute Abdomen</h1>
    <p>
      The abdominal cavity normally contains small amounts of peritoneal fluid
      that lubricates the organs. Peritonitis can be caused by any foreign
      material that builds up inside cavity. Some of these fluids could be pus,
      blood, feces, urine, gastric juice, intestinal contents, bile, pancreatic
      juice, amniotic fluid, or other materials

      GI hemorrhages can occur in the upper and lower parts of the GI tract. If
      bleeding occurs in the esophagus it could be caused from esophagitis,
      esophageal varices, or Mallory-Weiss tear (reulting from excessive
      vomiting). <strong>Hematemesis (vomiting blood)</strong> is usually seen
      in upper GI bleeds. Blood will usually appear to be bright read, or have
      the appearance of coffe grounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bleeding in the lower GI tract can be caused from bowel inflammation,
      diverticulosis, diverticulitis, cancer, and hemorrhoids.
      <strong>melena (dark tarry stools)</strong> will be present from the
      digestion of blodo.
