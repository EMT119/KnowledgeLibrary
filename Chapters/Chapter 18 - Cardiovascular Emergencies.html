      The cardiovascular system is comprised of three components: the heart
      (pump), blood vessels (container), and blood (fluid).
    </p>
    <h3>Structures of the Heart</h3>

        <p>
          The heart muscle is referred to as the <strong>myocardium</strong>.
          The <strong>pericardium</strong>, or <strong>pericardial sac</strong>,
          is a thick, fibrous membrane that surrounds the heart. The inner
          membrane of the pericardium contains the visceral layer and the
          parietal layer. The visceral layer of the pericardium lies against the
          heart and is also called the <strong>epicardium</strong>. The second
          layer of the pericardium, the parietal layer, is separated from the
          visceral layer by a small amount of
          <strong>pericardial fluid</strong> that reduces friction within the
          pericardial sac. The <strong>endocardium</strong> is the smooth inner
          lining of the chambers of the heart and the surface of the valves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two atria and two ventricles make up the upper and lower chambers of
          the heart, respectively. Each <strong>atrium</strong> receives blood
          that is returned to the heart from other parts of the body; each
          <strong>ventricle </strong> pumps blood out of the heart. The left
          ventricle is the strongest and largest of the four cardiac chambers
          because it is responsible for pumping blood through blood vessels
          throughout the body.

        <h3>Valves of the Heart</h3>
        <hr />

        <p>
          The valves of the heart include the
          <strong>atrioventricular valves</strong> (these are the
          <strong>tricuspid valve and the mitral valve</strong> [also known as
          the bicuspid valve]) and the
          <strong
            >semilunar valves (these are the aortic valve and the pulmonic
            valve)</strong
          >
          Figure 18-2. Papillary muscles in the ventricles contract to tighten
          the <strong>chordae tendineae</strong>, preventing blood from flowing
          backward into the atria.

        <h3>Coronary Circulation</h3>
        <hr />

          The left main coronary artery is the largest and shortest of the
          myocardial blood vessels. It rapidly divides into two branches, the
          <strong>left anterior descending (LAD)</strong> artery and the
          <strong>circumflex coronary artery</strong>. These arteries subdivide
          further, supplying blood to most of the left ventricle, the
          interventricular septum (the thick walls between the ventricles), and,
          at times, the <strong>atrioventricular (AV) node</strong>.

    <h3>the Electrical Conduction System</h3>
    <div class="columns">
      <div class="flex-50">
        <img src="./images/chapter 18/heart conduction.png" />
      </div>
      <div class="flex-50">
        <p>
          The <strong>sinoatrial (SA) node</strong>, located high in the right
          atrium, is the normal site of origin of the electrical impulse. It is
          the heart's natural pacemaker and has an intrinsic rate of 60 to 100
          beats/min. If the SA node is not functioning properly, the AV node may
          take over as the heart's pacemaker. The intrinsic rate of the
          <strong>AV node</strong> is 40 to 60 beats/min. Rhythms originating
          <strong>below the AV node</strong> have an intrinsic rate of 20 to 40
          beats/min. Impulses originating in the SA node travel through the
          right and left atria, resulting in atrial contraction. The impulse
          then travels to the AV node, located in the right atrium adjacent to
          the septum, where it transiently slows. Electrical stimulation of the
          heart muscle then continues toward the bundle of His, which is a
          continuation of the AV node. From here, it proceeds rapidly to the
          right and left bundle branches, stimulating the interventricular
          septum. The impulse then spreads out through the rest of the
          conduction system, resulting in ventricular contraction, or systole.

    <h1 class="bg-dark-red">Pathophysiology</h1>
    <h2>Atherosclerosis</h2>
    <p>
      A disorder in which fatty material called cholesterol and other fatty
      substances build up and form plaque inside the walls of the blood vessels.
      This can obstruct flow, and interfere with the ability to contract or
      dilate. This buildup can start as early as the teenage years. As the
      person ages the deposit can grow causing a narrowing of the artery. Over
      time this turns the once smooth and elastic artery into one that is rough
      and brittle. <strong>Arteriosclerosi</strong> can also cause reduction in
      blood flow
    </p>
    <p>
      With some of the sharp edges that develop on the wall they activat ethe
      bodies clotting system. This in turn causes the artery to become further
      obstructed or blocked entirely. When this happens it is known as
      <strong>acute myocardial infarction (AMI)</strong>.
