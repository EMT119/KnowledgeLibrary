      Anatomy and Physiology Review: The Female Reproductive System
    </h1>
    <p>
      The female reproductive system is made up of the ovaries, fallopian tubes,
      uterus, cervix, vagina, and breasts. Hormones will stimulate the ovaries
      to produce oocytes which causes it to undergo oogenesis that will result
      in a mature egg (<b>ovum</b>). The ovum is released approximately every 28
      days. The egg travels through the fallopian tubes, these tubes extend from
      the uterus to the ovary where fertilization normally occurs. The fallopian
      tubes then exit into the uterus.

    <p>
      During a menstrual cycel the lining of the uterus thickens in preparation
      for pregnancy. If fertilization occurs then the egg will embed itself in
      the lining of the uterus, however if fertilization does not occur then the
      uterus will shed which causes what we know as <b>menstruation</b>

          The <b>vagina</b> is what receives the male penis during sexual
          intercour. The muscular walls of the vagina are able to expand and
          stretcher to allow childbirth. Female genitalia include the vulva,
          labia minor, the clitoris, prepuce, labia major, and mons pubis. The
          <b>periuneum</b> is the area between the urethral opening and the
          anus. It includes skin, external genitalia, and underlysing tissues.

    <h1 class="bg-dark-red">Gestation</h1>
    <p>
      <b>Gestation</b> refers to the process of feta development following
      fertilization of an egg. A fertilized egg is called a <b>zygote</b>, when
      this egg is fertilized (usually in the distal third of the fallopian tube)
      it will move from the fallopian tube and to the uterus. The zygote will
      being progressive cell divison. After the <b>embryo</b> contains
      approximately 32 cells it will implant in the uterine wall. As mentioned
      above the uterine wall has thickened in preparation for implantation, this
      thickening is caused by progeterone. Implanation generally takes place 7
      days after fertilization. There are two groups that split to become the
      embryo and placenta. The embryo is formed from the inner group of
      blastocyst cells known as embyroblast. The placenta is formed from the
      outer group of cells known as the trophoblast. During fertilization to the
      end of nine weeks the blastocyst is referred to as a an <b>embyro</b>,
      however 10 weeks and beyond it is known as a <b>fetus</b>
