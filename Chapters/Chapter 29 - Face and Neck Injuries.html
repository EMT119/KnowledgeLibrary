    <h2>Bones and Landmarks</h2>
    <p>
      The head is divided into two parts: the cranium and the face. The cranium,
      or skull, contains the brain. The face is composed of the eyes, ears,
      nose, mouth, and cheeks. The facial skeleton is composed of six major
      bones: the nasal bone, the two maxillae (upper jaw bones), the two zygomas
      (cheek bones), and the mandible (jaw bone)

    <p>
      One bone not shown in the images above is the
      <strong>hyoid bone</strong> it functions to stablize and support the
      larynx and is a point of attachment for many neck and tongue muscles
    </p>
    <p>
      Below shows the anatomy of the anterior throat. This consists of the
      larynx which is formed by the thyroid cartilage. Below that is the cricoid
      cartilage, between them is a thing sheet of connective tissue called
      fascia otherwise known as the <strong>cricothyroid membrane</strong>

    <h2>The Eye</h2>
    <div class="columns">
      <div class="flex-50">
        <p>
          The eye is approximately 1 inch in diameter. It is located inside the
          orbit and is held in by loose connective tissue and muscles. The
          muscles that hold it in place are also what allows the eye to have
          movement. The eye uses two nerves, <strong>oculomotor</strong> and
          <strong>optic</strong>. The oculomotor nerve is use to constrict the
          pupil and accomodation of the lens. The optic nerve is used for
          vision.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="flex-50">
        <img src="./images/chapter 29/eye.png" alt="" />
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      The eyeball is able to keep its shape due to pressure of fluid within two
      chambers. The anerior is filled with <strong>aqueous humor</strong>, this
      fluid may be replenished an injury occurs. However
      <strong>vitreous humor</strong> is a jellylike substance that is unable to
      be replenished and blindness may result from an injury. The exterior white
      part of the eye is called <strong>sclera</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eye is covered by a delicate membrane known as
      <strong>conjunctiva</strong>, this membrane must be kept moist and this is
      done by the <strong>lacrimal glands</strong> (tear glands). Another
      important structure in the eye is the <strong>pupil</strong>. This
      structure acts like a camera lense and dilates and constricts to regulate
      light coming into the eye. Pupils should be equal but a condition known as
      <strong>anisocoria</strong> may cause pupils to be unequal. If pupils are
      unequal and the patient does not have this condition and the patient is
      unresponsive then a head injury should be suspected.

    <h2>The Ear</h2>
    <div class="columns">
      <div class="flex-50">
        <p>
          The ear is a complex organ that is associated with hearing and
          balance. The ear is divided into three parts. The external ear is
          composed of the <strong>pinna</strong>, or <strong>auricle</strong>,
          which is the part lying outside of the head, and the external auditory
          canal, which leads in toward the tympanic membrane, or eardrum. The
          middle ear contains three small bones (the malleus, incus, and stapes)
          that move in response to sound waves hitting the tympanic membrane. It
          is connected to the nasal cavity by the eustachian tube, which permits
          equalization of pressure in the middle ear when external atmospheric
          pressure changes. The inner ear is composed of bony chambers filled
          with fluid. As the head moves, so does the fluid. In response, fine
          nerve endings within the fluid send impulses to the brain indicating
          the position of the head and the rate of change of position.

    <h1 class="bg-dark-red">Pathophysiology</h1>
    <h2>Facial Fractures</h2>
    <p>
      If a patient presents with facial fractures then it is within reason to
      suspect that the patient may have a closed head injury or cervical spine
      fractures. Some signs that you may note are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ecchymosis (discoloration of the skin)</li>
      <li>Swelling</li>
      <li>Pain on palpation</li>
      <li>Crepitus (bones moving against each other)</li>
      <li>Misalignment of the teeth</li>
      <li>Facial deformities or asymmetry</li>
      <li>Instability of the facial bones</li>
      <li>Impaired ocular movement</li>
      <li>Visual disturbances</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Nasal Fractures</h3>
    <p>
      These injuries are usually accompanied by a nosebleed
      (<strong>epistaxis</strong>). Some signs will swelling, tenderness, and
      crepitus
    </p>
    <h3>Mandibular Fractures</h3>
    <p>
      Since significant force is required to fracture the mandible then it is
      possible that there is fractures in more than one place. Some signs of
      this are <strong>malocclusion</strong> (misalignment of the teeth),
      numbness of the chin, and inability to open the mouth. Take note if teeth
      are missing, patient experiences pain when opening their mouth to talk,
      range of motion that the jaw has. In very rare cases patients can
      experience <strong>temporomandibular joint dislocation</strong>. This is
      mostly commonly seen when someone has an exaggerated yawn which locks the
      mouth into a wide-open position
    </p>
    <h2>Maxillary Fractures</h2>
    <p>
      These types of fractures are mostly caused from massive trauma such as
      MVCs, falls, and assaults. These fractures are broken into three
      categories known as <strong>Le Fort fractures</strong>
    </p>

      <div class="flex-50">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Le Fort I fracture</strong></li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Horizontal fracture of the maxilla that separates the hard palate
              and lower maxilla from the remainder of the skull
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>Le Fort II fracture</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Fracture involving nasal bone and inferior maxilla. This fracture
              separates the nasal bone and lower maxilla from the facial skull
              and remainder of the cranial bones
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Le Fort III fracture (craniofacial disjunction)</strong>
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Fracture of all midfacial bones, separating the entire midface
              from the cranium
            </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h3>Orbital Fractures</h3>
    <p>
      Patients with tghese injuries may experience double vision
      (<strong>diplopia</strong>), some lose of sensation due to nerve damage
      may present.
