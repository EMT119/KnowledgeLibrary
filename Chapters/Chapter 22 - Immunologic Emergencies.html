      The <strong>immune system</strong> protects the body from substances and
      organisms that are foreign to the body. There are two types of systems,
      cellular immunity and humoral immunity.
      <strong>Cellular immunity</strong>, this is where the body creates
      specialized white blood cells called <i>T-cells</i> that attack and
      destory invaders. <strong>Humoral immunity</strong> is when B cell
      lymphocytes produce anitbodies that dissolve in the plasma and lymph to
      wage ware on invading organisms. These cells are located throughout the
      body in the lymph nodes, spleen, and gastrointestinal tract.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the right circumstances almost any substance can cause an allergic
      reaction. Although allergens can come from anything they will usually fall
      into one of five categories.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Insect bites and stings</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          This occurs when an insect bites or stings you and injects venom into
          your body. Injecting venom is called <strong>envenomation</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li><strong>Medications</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Depending on the route of medication it could be immediate and severe
          (injected medications) or take up to 30 minutes (oral).
          <span class="h h-red"
            >Just because someone has taken a medication before does not mean
            they cannot have a reaction to that medication.</span
          >
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li><strong>Plants</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          This can be caused by dust, pollen, mold, mildew, and other organic
          materials
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li><strong>Foods</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          This can be caused by ingesting food that someone is allergic to.
          These reactions take more than 30 minutes to appear, however the
          reaction can be quite severe.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li><strong>Chemicals</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Certain chemicals can cause a reaction. This could be makeup, soap,
          hair dye, latex, or other substances.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>
      An <strong>antibody</strong> is a protein the body produces in response to
      a <strong>antigen</strong>.

          The first encounter with a foreign material begins the
          <strong>primary response</strong> which mainly involves the white
          blood cells. When these immune cells engulf the invaders they will
          record one or two proteins on the surface of the substance to help
          design antibodies to match and inactivate each substance.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Basophils</strong> are stationed in specific sties within the
          tissues. <strong>Mast cells</strong> are on patrol. These cells
          produce "chemical weapons" also known as
          <strong>chemical mediators</strong>. The way this works if these
          substances are encapsulated and only released if an antigen invades
          and combines with one of the antibodies. If this happens the granules
          are ejected from mast cells. These chemical mediators summon white
          blood cells to the area. This also increases the blood flow to the
          area by dilating the blood vessels and increasing capillary
          permeability.

      There are two types of immunitys, acquired and natural.
      <strong>acquired immunity</strong> is produced by administering a vaccine
      that allows the body to produce anitbodies with experiencing the disease.
      <strong>Natural immunity</strong> is when the body encounters the antigen
      and experiences a full immune response.

    <h2>Allergic Reactions Versus Anaphylaxis</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      There are two types of reactions. <strong>Local reactions</strong> is when
      the response is localized to a specific area, for example an insect bite
      will swell at the site where the bite occured.
      <strong>Systemic reactions</strong> occur throughout the body and usually
      involve multiple systems, examples could include someone who has eaten
      something they are allergic to. <strong>Hypersensitivity</strong> is when
      the body responds in an exaggerated way after coming into contact with a
      substance.
    </p>
    <h2>Pathophysiologic Response</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Someone with allergies are more sensitive than someone without. As someone
      with allergies may identify harmless substances as potential threats.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the body reacts it releases two chemical mediators,
      <strong>histamine and leukotrienes</strong>. Histamine will cause blood
      vessels in a local area to dilate. Luekotrienes are also released but are
      more powerful that histamines, they also cause dilation and capillary
      leaking.

    <p>
      As histamines are released they cause vasodilation which usually presents
      as flushed skin. When vascular permeability increases this can result in
      <strong>angioedema (swelling of the face and tongue)</strong>, fluid
      secretion, and fluid loss. <strong>Urticaria (hives)</strong> can also be
      present.

    <p>
      It is important for the provider to be able to distinguish between
      anaphylaxis versus other conditions. If you determine that your patient is
      in anaphylaxis follow the list below:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Remove the offending agent</li>
      <li>Position the patient as appropriate</li>
      <li>Apply high-flow oxygen, or assist ventilation as needed</li>
      <li>Obtain IV access</li>
      <li>Give fluid resuscitation</li>
      <li>
        Administer epinephrine and an antihistamine (diphenhydramine for
        example) as indicated
      </li>
      <li>Transport promptly</li>
      <li>
        Frequently reassess the patient, and provide psychological support
