    <p>
      Soft-tissue injuries can be caused from several things ranging from blunt
      injuries to lacerations. These injuries are faily common and can cause
      tissue death due to hemorrhage or infection.
    </p>
    <h1 class="bg-dark-red">Anatomy and Physiology Review</h1>
    <h2>Skin Structure and Function</h2>
    <p>
      The skin is the largest external organ and varies in thickness depending
      on location on the body and age of the individual. Skin is thicker on the
      soles of the feet where it is thinner on the eyelids
    </p>
    <p>
      Skin is divided into two layers: <strong>epidermis</strong> and
      <strong>dermis</strong>
    </p>
    <div class="columns">
      <div class="flex-50">
        <p>
          The <strong>epidermis</strong> is the external layer that is
          watertight and tough. This layer of skin is constantly replaced as
          cells are pushed to the surface from the germinal layers
        </p>
        <p>
          The <strong>dermis</strong> is the inner layer of skin. The dermis
          contains many structures such as sweat glands, hair follicles, and
          sebaceous glands.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dermis is vascular and small blood vessels reach up to the
          germinal cells, but no vessels are in the epidermis. However there are
          specialized nerve endings within the dermis
        </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      There are several orifices in the body that include the mouth, nose, anus,
      and vagina that are lined with <strong>mucous membranes</strong>. These
      surfaces are usually moist as they secrete a lubricant. The skin however
      plays a different role in regulating the body as it helps protect the body
      from foreign bodies as well as regulate temperature. When the body becomes
      how the vessels dilate and allows heat to radiate from the surface of the
      body. However when it is cold the vessels will constrict and shunt blood
      from the skin to prevent heat radiation.
    </p>
    <h2>Skin Tension lines</h2>
    <p>
      The skin is arranged in a way the provides tension all over the body.
      These patterns are known as <strong>tension lines</strong> Whenever a
      laceration occurs if it is parallel to the skin tension then it may remain
      closed, however if it is perpendicular to the tension then the laceration
      may require sutures or staples to remain closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Dynamic tension</strong> is in areas where muscles are present.
      This type of tension is varied based on the contraction of the muscle it
      is lying ontop of.
    </p>
    <h1 class="bg-dark-red">Pathophysiology of Closed and Open Injuries</h1>
    <p>There are three types of soft-tissue injuries</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Closed injury</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Damage occurs beneath skin or mucous membrane but the surface remains
          intact
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li><strong>Open injury</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          There is a break in the skin that exposes deeper tissues to potential
          contamination
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li><strong>Burns</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When soft tissue receives more energy than it can absorb without
          injury
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>Closed Injuries</h2>
    <p>
      Soft-tissue injuries are characterized by a history of blunt trauma, pain
      at the injury site, and swelling beneath the skin.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Contustion</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Bleeding beneath the skin that does not break the skin. Usually is
          from blunt force impacts. If the injury is great then fluid leaking
          into the damaged area will cause pain and swelling
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li><strong>Ecchymosis</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>A blue or black discoloration due to blood buildup</li>
      </ul>
      <li><strong>Hematoma</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A pool of blood that has collected within damaged tissue or in a body
          cavity. This can be caused by any injury such as blunt force trauma or
          a fracture
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="h h-red"
            >Some can contain more than 1 liter of blood</span
          >
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In some injuries if an object is restricting or causes compression then a
      patient will had damage to the part of the body that is unable to receive
      blood flow. This is known as <strong>crush syndrome</strong>, this
      syndrome is when tissue becomes necrotic after blood that is trapped
      starts to release harmful products. Once the object that is trapping the
      blood is released the harmful products will flow the blood back to the
      heart, in most of these cases it will cause the patient to go into cardiac
      arrest (this is due to the high amounts of potassium). These patients may
      also have issues with renal failure due to the increased work on the
      kidneys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another syndrome that can cut off blood flow is
      <strong>compartment syndrome</strong>. This is when blood vessels become
      compressed due to pressure from fluids that are leaking around them.
    </p>
    <h2>Open Injuries</h2>
    <div class="columns">
      <div class="flex-50">
        <p>
          Open injuries bring some other issues than closed injuries. In open
          injuries there is there can be extensive bleeding, possibility of
          infection due to the protective layer being broken.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Abrasion</strong></li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A superficial wound that is caused by friction when the body part
              rubs or scrapes across a rough or hard surface
            </li>
            <li>
              Generally not severe, but can be if the wound covers a large
              surface area like in cases of road rash
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li><strong>Laceration</strong></li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A cut caused by a sharp object or blunt force. These cuts can be
              smooth or jagged. If the laceration includes an artery or veins
              then there will be extensive bleeding
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li><strong>Avulsion</strong></li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              This injury is best defined as a flap. This is when an injury
              separates tissues so that it is hanging by a piece of the tissue.

    <h2>Pathyophysiology of Wound Healing</h2>
    <h3>Infection</h3>
    <p>
      Whenever there is an open injury it poses the possibility of infection.
      Two of the most common types of bacterial infections are
      <i>Staphylococcus</i> and <i>Streptococcus</i>. It may take several days
      for signs of an infection to present, but some of these signs can include:
      erythema, pus, warmth, edema, and local discomfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the patient develops red streaks next to their wound then this is most
      likely <i>lymphangitis</i> which is inflammation of the lymph channels.
    </p>
    <h3>Gangrene</h3>
    <p>
      This is when tissue starts to die due to the lack of blood floow to the
      tissue. <i>Clostridium perfingens</i> is an example of a toxin-producing
      bacterium that can develop into gangrene, it also produces a foul-smelling
      gas. Remember if it is not treated then it can progress into sepsis
    </p>
    <h3>Tetanus</h3>
    <p>
      This is caused by the <i>Clostridium tetani</i> bacterium, it generally
      causes painful muscle contractions that can fracture bones
    </p>
    <h3>Nectrotizing Fasciitis</h3>
    <p>
      This is also known as "the flesh-eating disease". It is due to
      inflammation of the fascia
    </p>

      Emergency Medical Care of Closed and Open Injuries
    </h1>
    <h2>Closed Injuries</h2>
    <p>
      If the injury is minor then it can be managed by using the mnemonic
      <b>RICES</b>
    </p>
    <table class="dark">
      <thead>
        <th class="header" colspan="2">RICES</th>
      </thead>
      <tr>
        <td>Rest</td>
        <td>Keep the patient as comfortable as possible</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Ice</td>
        <td>
          Apply cold packs to the injuried area (this can help with bleeding as
          well as it constricts the blood vessels)
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Compression</td>
        <td>This helps stopn bleeding as it compresses the blood vessels</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Elevate</td>
        <td>Raise the injury above the heart to help reduce swelling</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Splint</td>
        <td>Helps prevent motion and further damage to the area</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <span class="h h-red"
      >Remember to check Pulse, Motor, and Sensory before and after
      splinting</span
    >
    <h2>Management of Specific Wounds</h2>
    <h3>Avulsion</h3>
    <p>
      If possible position the flap back to its original position and bandage
    </p>
    <h3>Amputation</h3>
    <p>
      Depending on the type of amputation it may be difficult to control
      bleeding. If the amputation is to a large area then it may be necessary to
      apply a tourniquet and treat the patient for hypovolemic shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember most of the time amputations can be reattached so it is important
      to keep the amputation sterile and bring it with you to the hospital.
    </p>
    <h3>Abdominal Wounds</h3>
    <p>
      If organs are protruding from the wound do <b>NOT</b> try to push them
      back in. Cover them with a sterile and moist gauze. Keep in mind that the
      patient will lose heat rapidly so it is important to keep them warm
    </p>
    <h1 class="bg-dark-red">Burns</h1>
    <p>
      When skin is burned it creates a leathery substance known as
      <strong>eschar</strong>. This can create issues since it does not act like
      normal skin and will not stretch when excess pressure is applied. As edema
      builds up it can cause compression on any structure underneath the eschar
      resulting in compartment syndrome.
    </p>
    <h2>Hypovolemic Shock</h2>
    <p>
      This type of shock can occur for two reasons: fluid loss and a volume
      shift of fluid. In burns it is generally a volume shift as fluid will leak
      out into the interstitial space. As this happens blood pressure will
      decrease causing the body to become tachycardic and vasoconstrict. These
      patients will require adequate fluid resuscitation
    </p>
    <h2>Burn Zones</h2>
    <p>
      There are three burn zones, these zones radiate from the greatest damage
      out
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Zone of coagulation</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Decreased blood flow and inflammation</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Zone of stasis</li>
      <ul>
        <li>May undergo tissue necrosis if perfusion is compromised</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Zone of hyperemia</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Least affected zone, typically recover in 7 to 10 days</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>Burn Depth</h2>
    <p>
      Like burn zones, burn depth is classified into three categories:
      superficial, partial thickness, and full thickness
    </p>
    <div class="columns">
      <div class="flex-50">
        <ul>
          <li>Superficial (formerly first degree)</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Skin turns red but does not blister</li>
            <li>Quite painful</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Partial-thickness burns (formerly second degree)</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Involves the epidermis and portion of the dermis</li>
            <li>Usually moist, mottled, and white to red</li>
            <li>Blisters are common</li>
            <li>Cause intense pain</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Full-thickness (formerly third degree)</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Extends through all skin layers</li>
            <li>Can appear to be white, dark brown, or charred</li>
            <li>
              If nerve endings have been destroyer then there will be no pain,
              however areas surrounding burn will be extremely painful
            </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>
          There are technically 6 categories to burns but in the prehospital
          setting the first three categories are the most often used
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="flex-50">
        <img src="./images/chapter 28/burns.png" />
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Burn Severity</h2>
    <p>
      There are five factors that can help you determine the severity of a burn
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Depth of the burn?</li>
      <li>Extent of the burn?</li>
      <li>Critical areas involved? or circumferential burns?</li>
      <li>Preexisting medical conditions that can cause complications</li>
      <li>Patient younger than 5 years or older than 55 years?</li>

          The easiest way to calculate TBSA burned is by using the
          <strong>rule of nines</strong>, this method divdes the body into 11
          sections with each representing roughly 9% of the TBSA
        </p>
        <p>
          If the burn area is less than 10% then it is recommended to use the
          <strong>rule of palms</strong> which utilizes the patient's palm to
          represent roughly 1% of the TBSA
        </p>

    <h1 class="bg-dark-red">Emergency Medical Care of Burns</h1>
    <p>
      For patients with major burns then fluid resuscitation will be critical
      point in their possibility of survival. In these patients a special
      formula known as the <strong>consensus formula</strong> (formerly parkland
      formula).
    </p>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        2-4 mL x Patient's weight (kg) x Percentage of body surface area burned
        = <br />Total fluid in 24 hours
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      This formula also says to give half the fluid during the first 8 hours
      then give the remaining half over the next 16 hours. However if the
      patient shows signs of inadequate perfusion then it is permitted to do a
      20mL/kg boluses to maintain perfusion
    </p>
    <p>
      A important thing to note is to not fluid overload these patients in the
      field as the patient could develop pulmonary edeam or actue respiratory
      distress syndrome
