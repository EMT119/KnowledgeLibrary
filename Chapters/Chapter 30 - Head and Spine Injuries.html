    <h1>Chapter 30 - Head and Spine Injuries</h1>
    <p>
      When studying trauma related to the head it is important to know some
      terminology
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Head trauma</strong> refers to both head injuries and traumatic
        brain injuries
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Head injury</strong> is when there is a injury to the head but
        not the face
      </li>
      <li>
        strong{Traumtic brain injury (TBI) this is an injury that is caused to
        the brain that can cause physical, emotional, social, and vocational
        consequences
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The nervous system is divided into two parts: central and peripheral. The
      <strong>central nervous system (CNS)</strong> is composed of the brain and
      spinal cord. The <strong>peripheral nervous system</strong> conducts
      sensory and motor impulses to and from the skin, muscles, and other organs
      to the spinal cord.

        <h2>The Skull</h2>
        <p>
          The skull is broken into two group: cranium and facial bones. The
          cranium is several thick bones fused together and it functions to hold
          and protect the brain. It is comprised of 80% brain tissue, 10% blood
          supply, and 10% <strong>cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The bone on the back of the skull is known as the occipital bone, the
          bones on the lateral side of the skull are called the temporal regions
          and between them lie the parietal bones. The forehead is composed of
          the frontal bone.
        </p>
        <p>
          The face is composed of 14 bones. The upper, nonmoveable jawbones are
          called the maxillae, the cheekbones are called the zygomas, and the
          mandible is the lower, moveable portion of the jaw.
        </p>
        <p>
          The orbit (eye socket) is made up of the frontal bone of the cranium
          and two facial bones: the maxilla and the zygoma. Together, these
          bones form a solid bony rim that protrudes around the eye to protect
          it. The nose mostly consists of flexible cartilage; in fact, only the
          proximal third of the nose is formed by bone with short bones forming
          the bridge of the nose.
