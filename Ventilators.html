    <h2>Two Main Modes of Mechanical Ventilations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>A/C MV - Assist/Controlled Mechanical Ventilation</li>
      <li>SIMV - Synchronized Intermittent Mechanical Ventilation</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Controlled Ventilations</h2>

    <h3>Volume Controlled</h3>
    <p>Same amount of tidal volume each breath</p>

    <h3>Pressure Controlled</h3>
    <p>Will ventilate until it reaches set pressure (tidal volume will vary)</p>

    <h2>Ventilator Settings</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>FiO2 - Percentage of Oxygen (Room air is 21%)</li>
      <ul>
        <li>100% is from the bottle</li>
        <li>50% is 21% from the air and rest from the bottle</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Ptrig - Pressure needed to Trigger Breath</li>
      <li>PEEP - What is PEEP?</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Positive end-expiratory pressure</li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        Airway Pressure (Paw) - Backpressure in the airway (everyone is
        different)
      </li>
      <li>&#402; - frequency, how many breaths they take</li>
      <li>Ti - inhalation time, how many seconds does your inhalation take</li>
      <li>
        I:E Ratio - Inhalation/Exhalation Ratio (1:2 = your exhale is 2 as long
        as inhale)
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you take 2 seconds to breath in then it will take you 4 seconds to
          breath out
        </li>
        <li>Effected by Frequency and Ti</li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        Psupport - Pressure support, when using BiPAP, how much extra pressure
        is used during inhale
      </li>
    </ul>
